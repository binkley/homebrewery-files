### Traits

**Charge.** If the beetle knight moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target before hitting with its **Pincer Horn**, the attack deals an extra 13 (3d8) piercing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.  

**Hard Carapace.** When the beetle knight would take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a nonmagical weapon, reduce the damage by 3 (1d6).  

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The beetle knight makes two **Scything Arm-Blade** attacks.

***Scything Arm-Blade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

***Pincer Horn.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.  
If the beetle knight moved 20 ft. straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the attack deals 26 (4d10 + 4) piercing damage instead, and if the target is Medium or smaller, it is **grappled** (escape DC 14). While grappling a creature, the beetle knight can’t use this attack on another target. A grappled creature is **restrained**.

### Bonus Actions

***Fling.***  
*Strength save DC 14*, one creature grappled by the beetle knight.  
On a failed save, the target is thrown 1d6 × 10 feet and lands **prone**.  
If it hits a solid surface, it takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage per 10 feet thrown.  
If thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity save or take the same damage and fall **prone**.  

### Reactions
***Carapace Parry.*** *(1/Turn)*  
*Trigger:* A creature the beetle knight can see hits it with an attack. *Response:* The beetle knight adds +2 to its AC against that attack, possibly causing it to miss.  

### Description
These hulking insectoid sentinels guard corrupted ruins or the nests of greater horrors.  
Their bladed limbs scythe through foes, and their chitinous shells deflect even enchanted steel.  
When provoked, they charge like living battering rams, impaling prey upon their cruel horns.

### Design Notes (for DMs)

- Updated for 2024 layout and CR budget. Average DPR ≈ 28; defensive HP 95 with AC 19 → CR 4 confirmed.  
- “Carapace Parry” uses the new reaction economy and mirrors the 2024 Knight’s “Parry” trait.  
- Simplified condition wording and added a minor damage reduction to reflect heavy armor without inflating HP.
