# Investigator&rsquo;s Case

_Wondrous Item, Rare (requires attunement by a creature with an Intelligence score of 13 or higher)_

This compact leather case contains a neatly-packed array of lenses, vials, tweezers, and reagents useful for field investigations. The case and its contents are magically durable and seem to subtly guide your hand in their use.

You can use this case as a set of _[Alchemist&rsquo;s Supplies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#AlchemistsSupplies50GP)_ except for crafting.

_**Expert Analysis.**_ If you have proficiency with _Alchemist&rsquo;s Supplies_, add your Proficiency Bonus to any _Investigation_ check you make that uses the case. If you have proficiency in _Investigation_ used with that check, you have [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the check too.

_**Handy Tool.**_ You can use an action to identify a substance (DC 15), or to start a fire (DC 15).

_**Hidden Pocket.**_ A secret pocket is hidden within the case&rsquo;s lining, which can only be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (_Investigation_) check. The pocket can hold a tiny object such as a key or folded parchment.

_**Specialized Tools.**_ The case includes a _[magnifying glass](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#MagnifyingGlass100GP)_, a bottle of [ink](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Candle1CP), an [ink pen](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#InkPen2CP), two sheets of [parchment](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Parchment1SP), four [candles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Candle1CP), two pieces of [string](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#String1SP), a pouch of dusting powder, a folding 5-foot measuring rod, and two [vials](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Vial1GP). After you finish a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#LongRest), any of these items that are missing are magically replenished inside the case.

_**Charges.**_ In addition, the case has 2 charges and regains all expended charges after a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can expend one or more of its charges to activate one of these options:

- **Expend 1 charge.** You can cast _[Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#DetectMagic)_.
- **Expend 1 charge.** You can use the _Find Secret Doors_ feature.
- **Expend 1 charge.** You can cast _Find Traps_.
- **Expend 2 charges.** You can cast _[Knock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Knock)_.
- **Expend 2 charges.** You can cast _[Locate Object](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#LocateObject)_.

_**Find Secret Doors.**_ As an action, you sense the presence of any secret door or hidden compartment within 120 feet of you that is also _within your line of sight_. A secret door, for the purpose of this feature, includes any hidden passage or container intended to be concealed, such as a sliding wall or a false-bottomed chest. This feature reveals that such a secret is present, but does not reveal its exact location. You do, however, learn the general nature of its construction but not specifics of its operation.
