# Greater Pendant of Warning

_Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)_

This pendant features a large red garnet cabochon that briefly vibrates and flashes red at signs of trouble.

As long as this pendant is within your reach and you are attuned to it, you and allies within 30 feet of you gain the following benefits:

- **Alarm.** The pendant magically awakens each subject who is sleeping naturally when combat begins. This benefit doesnâ€™t wake a subject from magically induced sleep.
- **Supernatural Readiness.** Each subject has [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Advantage) on its [Initiative](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Initiative) rolls.

In addition, the pendant has 2 charges and regains all expended charges after a [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#LongRest). While wearing the pendant, you can expend one or more of its charges to activate one of these options:

- **Expend 1 charge.** You can cast _Find Traps_.
- **Expend 1 charge.** You can cast _[Magic Mouth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#MagicMouth)_ as an action.
- **Expend 2 charges.** You can cast _[See Invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#SeeInvisibility)_.
- **Expend 2 charges.** You can use the _Sense Hostility_ feature.

_**Sense Hostility.**_ As an action, you focus the pendant&rsquo;s power to perceive threats. For the next 10 minutes, you have a distinct sense of unease whenever a creature with hostile intentions comes within 60 feet of you. You do not know the creature&rsquo;s location or identity, only the direction from which you sense the presence of hostility.
