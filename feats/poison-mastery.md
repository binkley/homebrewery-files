### Poison Mastery
*General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+)*

Poisons are your expertise.
You use poison more effectively and those poisons you craft are more hazardous.

You gain the following benefits:

* **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* **Corrosion.** When you make a damage roll that deals Poison damage, you can choose to deal Acid damage instead. Additionally, you ignore [resistance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Resistance) to Poison damage. If you deal Acid damage to a creature that is [immune](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Immunity) to Poison, that creature gains resistance to your Acid damage.
* **Plague Doctor.** You bypass [immunity](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Immunity) to the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition. Once per [Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#LongRest), when you deal damage that would impose the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition on a creature normally immune to it, you ignore that immunity for that instance. The creature makes its saving throw with [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Advantage).
* **Brew Poison.** You gain proficiency with the [Poisoner's Kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#PoisonersKit50GP). With 1 hour of work using this kit and expending 50 GP worth of materials, you can create a number of poison doses equal to your Proficiency Bonus. If a poison requires more than 50 GP worth of materials to craft, your time is still 1 hour of work.
* **Fast Poisons.** As a [Bonus Action](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#BonusAction), you can apply any poison to any weapon or piece of ammunition within 5 feet. Once applied, the poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until the item deals damage, whichever is shorter.
* **Noxious Crafting.** When poison you crafted is used in a successful attack, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus the modifier of the ability increased by this feat) or take additional **2d8 Poison damage** and suffer the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition until the end of the attacker&rsquo;s next turn.
