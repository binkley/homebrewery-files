### Poison Mastery
*General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+)*

Poisons are your expertise.
You use poison more effectively and those poisons you craft are more hazardous.

You gain the following benefits:

* **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* **Potent Poison.** When you make a damage roll that deals Poison damage, it ignores [Resistance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Resistance) to Poison damage.
* **Plague Doctor.** Once per [Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#LongRest), [Immunity](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Immunity) becomes [Resistance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Resistance) for one target for Poison damage and the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition until the end of your next turn.
* **Quick Poisons.** As a [Bonus Action](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#BonusAction), you can apply poison to any weapon or up to 3 pieces of ammunition within 5 feet. Once applied, the poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you deal damage with the poisoned item, whichever is shorter. 
* **Brew Poison.** You gain proficiency with the [Poisoner's Kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#PoisonersKit50GP). With 1 hour of work using this kit and expending 50 GP worth of materials, you can create a number of [basic poison](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#PoisonBasic100GP) doses equal to your Proficiency Bonus. If a poison requires more than 50 GP worth of materials to craft, you still pay the material costs but can craft with 1 hour of work.
* **Noxious Crafting.** When poison you crafted is used in a successful attack, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take additional **2d8 Poison damage** and suffer the [Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition until the end of the attacker&rsquo;s next turn. The DC for this save is DC 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus the modifier of the ability increased by this feat.
