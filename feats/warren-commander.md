# Warren Commander

This feat is given to all players in the _Oh no, here come the Humans!_
one-shot adventure.

**Silvered Bone Whistle**. When blown on as an Action, Bonus Action, or
Reaction, its unique sound calls nearby hidden Kobolds to a guest-hero. A
Kobold Squad (consisting of 6 individual kobolds) emerges from the walls and
appear in unoccupied spaces near you as you choose. They act on your
initiative. If there are no nearby Kobolds, you are on your own.

While the squad is active, you gain the following options. You can use one
option each turn, and can use that option as an Action, Bonus Action, or
Reaction.

**Kobold Shield.** When you are hit by an attack or specified as a target for a spell or effect, you can have a squad member intercept it. You are unaffected by the attack or spell, and one member of the squad is removed from play. This does not protect you from effects that cover an area without targeting you specifically (such as a Fireball or Fog Cloud).

**Mass Sabotage.** You squad can deploy items from a _Hidden Cache_ within 10
feet of you; for example spreading Ball Bearings or Caltrops; setting a
Hunting Trap; light and throw flaming Oil; storing the item in your inventory.
Each turn you may deploy only one item from the cache in this way.

## Synergies

In addition, specific classes and species can draw on additional options from
your Kobold swarm:

**Draconic Inspiration.** When you use Draconic Cry, your squad is emboldened. Until the start of your next turn, the squad can intercept two attacks instead of one.

**Phantom Whistle.** If you have the Mimicry trait, you can project the sound
of the whistle to any point within 60 feet. The squad can emerge from a
hidey-hole near that point instead of near you.

**Tactical Harassment.** Your squad counts as an ally for the purpose of
triggering Sneak Attack. As long as one squad member is within 5 feet of your
target, you gain the benefit of your Sneak Attack feature.
