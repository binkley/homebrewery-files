# Warren Commander

This feat is given to all players in the "Oh no, here come the Humans!"
one-shot adventure.

Call forth a Kobold squad to fight by your side. Blow your **Silvered Bone
Whistle** as an Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction. Its unique sound calls a
nearby hidden Kobold squad to you. A squad of 6 Kobolds within 60 feet of you
draw close or emerge from cramped tunnels and hiding spots, and move to
surround you. If no Kobolds are within range, the whistle has no effect.

### Kobold Squad

The squad takes unoccupied spaces around you in a packed formation of your
choice. The squad follows you, and reposition as you choose as long as they
remain packed around you. They fight for their warren under your command until
dismissed but do not follow you beyond 60 feet from where they appeared.

While the squad is active, you can command them using your Action, Bonus
Action, or Reaction. You can use one command each of your turns as long as at
least one Kobold remains in your squad. They do not act on their own, and you
can only use one Command each of your turns.

**Cover and Obstruction.** Simply by being in the way your squad provides Half
Cover (+2 to AC and Dex saves) for you without using your Command.

### General Commands

- _**Camouflage.**_ You command the squad to mirror your movements using their
  knowledge of stone and shadows. If you use your action to Hide, your entire
  squad also gains the benefits of that action.
- _**Kobold Shield.**_ When you are hit by an attack or specified as a target
  for a spell or effect, you use your reaction to command a squad member to
  intercept. You are unaffected by the attack or spell, and one member of the
  squad is removed from play. This does not protect you from area effects that
  do not target you specifically (such as Fireball or Fog Cloud).
- _**Mass Sabotage.**_ You command the squad to store or deploy one item from
  a Hidden Cache within 30 feet of them. Your choices depend on the contents
  of the cache. They can store the item in your inventory, or deploy the item
  such as spreading Ball Bearings or Caltrops, set a Hunting Trap, or light
  and throw flaming Oil. Each turn you may store or deploy only one item from
  the cache in this way and you must be in 30 feet of the cache to store an
  item.

### Synergy Commands

For specific classes and species you can command your Kobold squad with
additional choices.

- _**Extra Sabotage.**_ When you use your **Fury of the Small** trait on a
  creature, you raise craftiness in your squad and can issue an additional
  command for Mass Sabotage as part of that same action, targeting that
  creature or its space. This does not count against your one command per
  turn limit.
- _**Fey Flanking.**_ If you are a **Fey** creature, you raise comraderie in
  the squad and command your squad to strike while a target is distracted.
  When you cast a spell requiring a saving throw, you use your reaction to
  command a squad member to use the Help action against the target, imposing a
  penalty on their save or granting an ally advantage on the next attack.
- _**Phantom Whistle.**_ If you have the **Mimicry** trait, you can use your
  command to project your voice to any point within 60 feet. The squad emerges
  at that point instead of near you arranged as you choose.
- _**Squad Inspiration.**_ When you use Draconic Cry, you embolden your squad.
  Until the start of your next turn, you can command the squad to intercept
  two attacks instead of one.
- _**Stage Presence.**_ You gain Advantage on Deception or Performance checks
  as you command your squad to act as guards, prisoners, or servants while you
  are using Shapechanger to appear as another creature.
- _**Tactical Harassment.**_ Your squad counts as an ally for the purpose of
  triggering your **Sneak Attack** as long as at least one squad member is
  within 5 feet of your target.
