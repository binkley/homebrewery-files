## Aura of Calm _(4th-level enchantment)_

_Your words and presence lower hostilities for now._ This is a greater version of the _Calm Emotions_ spell.

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You emanate an aura of supernatural charm by your words and presence that draws attention and softens hearts. Each creature of your choice that starts its turn within 20 feet of you, or enters the area for the first time on a turn, must make a Wisdom saving throw. Once the effect no longer applies to a creature &mdash; such as after a successful saving throw or the effect ending &mdash; it is immune for the rest of this casting of the spell.

On a failed save, choose one of the following effects for that creature:

- **Charm and Fear Suppression.** The creature has immunity to the _Charmed_ and _Frightened_ conditions until the spell ends. If the creature is already _Charmed_ or _Frightened_, those conditions are suppressed for the duration.  
- **Attitude Shift.** The creature’s attitude toward you and creatures you choose shifts one step friendlier (_Hostile_ &rarr; _Indifferent_, _Indifferent_ &rarr; _Friendly_) for as long as the effect lasts. This change happens even if the creature is currently engaged in combat.
- **Word to the Wise.** For any Charisma check you make with the affected creatures you can substitute a Wisdom check if appropriate.

If an affected creature within your aura is attacked by you or your companions, the effect ends for all affected creatures in the aura, though the aura remains. When an affected creature leaves the aura, it immediately makes another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends for that creature.

When the effect ends for a creature (including when the spell ends), the improved attitude persists unless a significant event changes their mind, such as continuing combat with them or their allies (DM&rsquo;s discretion).

_The aura moves with you, remaining centered on you for the spell’s duration._
