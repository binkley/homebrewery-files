{{note
The <em>Peasant Greatflail</em> is a threshing tool pressed into service on the battlefield. Unlike the knight&rsquo;s compact <em>military flail</em> from the _Player&rsquo;s Handbook_, this version is a long staff with swinging metal attached, originally used to separate grain from husks. Its reach allows farmers or impressed militia to batter armored foes or strike past shields, though its size is unwieldy in close quarters. Easy to wield in need, true mastery of the <em>Peasant Greatflail</em> requires martial weapon training to unlock its potential.

This weapon is a two-handed version of the military flail usable as a <em>simple</em> weapon.
