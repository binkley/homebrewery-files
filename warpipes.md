# Warpipes

_Wondrous Item, varies (requires attunement by a creature proficient with bagpipes)_

These battle bagpipes may have been carried by others before and now wielded as potent as any sword or bow or spell. Their lineage is as old as yours, and allies know to respect them as a sword or bow or spell. Ever feared is the performer for braw or woe.

##### Choose Your Pipes

This dumpy bag with tubes sticking out is never the same. You may add various pipes as need be for different tones, tunes, pitches and effects, and the instrument grows with you in power.

#### Charges and Rarity

The power of the pipes depends on their rarity. The pipes regain all expended charges after you finish a _Long Rest_.
- **Common.** There is 1 charge and is found with at least 2 sets of usable pipes.
- **Uncommon.** There are 3 charges and is found with at least 4 sets of usable pipes.
- **Rare.** There are 5 charges and is found with at least 6 sets of usable pipes.
- **Very Rare.** There are 7 charges and is found with at least 8 sets of usable pipes.

#### Innate Songs

The Warpipes possess minor magic not requiring specific pipes be fitted. While holding the pipes, you can use an action to produce one of the following effects:

_**Inspiring Trill.**_ You play a short, inspiring musical phrase. Choose one ally you can see within 60 feet of you who can hear you. Once within the next minute, that ally can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of their choice.

_**Discordant Note.**_ You play a jarring, off-key note directed at one enemy you can see within 60 feet of you who can hear you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13) or have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

#### Changing the Tune

You can use a _Bonus Action_ to change pipes. You can only have set of pipes attached at a time. As an action, you can play the installed pipe by expending the required number of charges to create its magical effect.
