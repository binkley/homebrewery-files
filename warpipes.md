# Warpipes

_Wondrous Item, varies (requires attunement by a creature proficient with bagpipes)_

These battle bagpipes were carried by others before and are as potent as any sword or bow or spell. Their lineage is as old as yours, and allies know to respect them or duck. Ever feared is the performer for braw or woe.

{{note

##### Choose Your Pipes

This dumpy bag with tubes sticking out is never the same. You may change pipes as needed for different tones, tunes, pitches and effects, and the instrument grows with you in power. When equipped, standard musical pipes are attached and may include additional sets of pipes.
}}

To use effects of the Warpipes, you must use your _Action_ and proficiency in [bagpipes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/463-bagpipes) to play the instrument. You can also play them as simple bagpipes:

**Utilize:** Play a known tune (DC 10), or improvise a song (DC 15)

#### Found Instrument

The power the instrument depends on its rarity and the sets of pipes. All expended charges are regained after you finish a _Long Rest_. To _attune_ to the _Warpipes_, you must be a minimum level.

| Rarity | Charges | Sets of Pipes | Attunement Level |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Common | 1 | 2 | 1 |
| Uncommon | 3 | 4 | 3 |
| Rare | 5 | 6 | 6 |
| Very Rare | 7 | 8 | 11 |
| Legendary | 9 | 10 | 17 |

Some _Warpipes_ are found with sets of pipes included. Other sets of pipes are found while adventuring. Each _Warpipes_ instrument may have different sets of pipes and more rare instruments may have less common pipes.

| Rarity | Typical Pipes |
|:-:|--|
| Common | Pipes of Bane, Pipes of Blessing |
| Uncommon| Pipes of Bane, Pipes of Blessing, ?? |
| Rare | Pipes of Bane, Pipes of Blessing, ??, ?? |
| Very Rare | Pipes of Bane, Pipes of Blessing, ??, ??, Pipes of Pain |
| Legendary | Pipes of Bane, Pipes of Blessing, ??, ??, Pipes of Pain, ??|

#### Warming Up

The _Warpipes_ possess minor magics that do not require charges. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

As an _Action_, you can rehearse a continuous drone for the flow of battle, lasting until the start of your next turn. While your warming-up tones are active, you can use your _Reaction_ to make a sharp note for a creature you can see within 60 feet.

That note affects an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make. You choose whether to add a d4 to or subtract a d4 from the roll. You can use this _Reaction_ after the d20 is rolled, but before the outcome is determined.

#### Changing the Tune

You can use a _Bonus Action_ to replace pipes. If an ally within 5 feet can see you changing pipes, they can assist as a _Reaction_ &mdash; no longer requiring your _Bonus Action_. That ally gains _Advantage_ on _saving throws_ for any effects of the new pipes.

### Pipes

When a set of pipes has an effect requiring an ability check or a saving throw, the difficulty ([DC](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#DifficultyClass)) is your choice of:

- 8 + your Performance [skill](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Skill) bonus
- 8 + your [proficiency bonus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/playing-the-game#Proficiency) + your Charisma bonus

#### Pipes of Pain

These pipes require **4 charges** from your _Warpipes_ to play. You play _The King Under the Water_.

Towering tones ripple outward from you in a 30-foot _Emanation_. Each creature in the Emanation makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 5d6 Thunder damage and 5d6 Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice) and has the _Prone_ condition. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

Each creature you choose in the Emanation can use a _Reaction_ to cover their ears and throw themselves _Prone_ to take no damage.

### Upgrading Your Instrument

Increasing the rarity _Warpipes_ is a large task not achievable by a single crafter. Your instrument is a complex maneuver of wood, leather, fabric, metal, and magic. Seek out suitable artisans, and it never hurts to get a _Cleric&rsquo;s_ blessing.

You may not upgrade the rarity of your _Warpipes_ without approval by the DM.

#### Time and Cost

Upgrading the rarity of your _Warpipes_ requires the same cost and tools as crafting a magic item from scratch. With required assistance the time is 1/2 that of for crafting a magic item from scratch. For upgrading to _Rare_ or greater rarity, your DM may require hard-to-find materials.

#### Artisan Assistance

Upgrading _Warpipes_ needs collaboration. In addition to your own crafting skills, the help of other artisans is needed.

| Old Rarity | New Rarity | Artisans | Crafts |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|--|
| Common | Uncommon | 1 | _Leatherworker_, _Metalsmith_, _Tailor_, _Tinker_ or _Woodcarver_ |
| Uncommon | Rare | 2 | _Leatherworker_, _Metalsmith_, _Tailor_, _Tinker_ or _Woodcarver_ |
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 1 | _Alchemist_, _Calligrapher_ or _Painter_, _Jeweler_ |
| Rare | Very Rare | 3 | _Leatherworker_, _Metalsmith_, _Tailor_, _Tinker_ or _Woodcarver_ |
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 2 | _Alchemist_, _Calligrapher_ or _Painter_, _Jeweler_ |
| Very Rare | Legendary | 4 | _Leatherworker_, _Metalsmith_, _Tailor_, _Tinker_ or _Woodcarver_ |
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 3 | _Alchemist_, _Calligrapher_ or _Painter_, _Jeweler_ |

_**Alchemist:**_ An Alchemist can create special oils and resins to treat woods and fabrics, making them resistant to fire, rot, or magical corruption. This treatment is crucial for the instrument's survival in perilous conditions.

_**Calligrapher / Painter:**_ A master of these can adorn the instrument with delicate runes or symbols of power. These are not merely decorative; they can be imbued with minor spells or blessings that the wielder can call upon.

_**Jeweler:**_ A Jeweler can inlay your _Warpipes_ with precisely matched gemstones. These gems can serve as arcane foci, extra storage for magical charges, or show the presence of nearby magic or enemies.

_**Leatherworker:**_ The instrument&rsquo;s lungs is the leather Bag. Typically sheepskin or cow, an upgrade might need magical hide, such as that of a _Displacer Beast_, to contain volatile energies.

_**Metalsmith:**_ Parts such as ferrules (metal rings to prevent the wood-splitting) or mounts (for pipe attachments) require this artisan. For a greater upgrades, you might need mithral or inscribed runes of power.

_**Tailor:**_ Covering the Bag is a public face and protective layer. This artisan crafts an ornate cover from fine fabrics embroidering it with meaningful symbols and tassles. More powerful _Warpipes_ may use spider silk or threads of pure silver.

_**Tinker:**_ Without this artisan and their precision, you may struggle to keep stocks airtight or the blowpipe valve from failing. And they love adding their own magical touches.

_**Woodcarver:**_ The instrument&rsquo;s heart is in the delicate reeds providing the distinctive character to your instrument. This is apparent in chanter, drones, and wooden sets of pipes. Rare woods like Ironwood or a branch from a Feywild tree may better resonate to your magical tones.
