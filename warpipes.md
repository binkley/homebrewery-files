# Warpipes

_Wondrous Item, varies (requires attunement by a creature proficient with Bagpipes)_

These battle bagpipes may have been carried by others and are now as potent as any sword, bow or spell. Wise allies know to respect them or duck come braw or woe.

{{note
##### Choose Your Pipes

This handsome bag is never the same. Different pipes give different magic. The instrument grows with crafting.
}}

These remain [bagpipes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/463-bagpipes). You may use them as such including their features.

Your DM decides which sets of magical pipes are found with your instrument. Your instrument always include one set of non-magical musical pipes. To use effects of the Warpipes, you must use your _Action_ to play them.

#### Found Instrument

The power the instrument depends on its rarity and the sets of pipes used to play.

_**Attunement.**_ _Warpipes_ require [Attunement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Attunement). To attune you must be _proficient with Bagpipes_ and have a minimum character level determined by the instrument&rsquo;s rarity as shown in the table.

_**Charges.**_ The instrument has a maximum number of charges determined by its rarity. After you finish a _Long Rest_, it regains a number of expended charges as shown in the Recharge column of the table.

_**Risk of Overuse.**_ If you expend the instrument&rsquo;s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the _Warpipes_ play a final, sad tone and become a nonmagical instrument.

| Rarity | Charges | Recharge | Found Pipes | Effect DC | Minimum Level |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Common | 1 | 1 | 2 | 11 | 1 |
| Uncommon | 3 | d4 | 4 | 13 | 3 |
| Rare | 5 | d6 | 6 | 15 | 7 |
| Very Rare | 7 | d8 | 8 | 17 | 11 |

#### Changing the Tune

You can use a [Bonus Action](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#BonusAction) to replace a set of pipes. A creature within 5 ft. can use their [Reaction](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Reaction) to assist. That creatures gains [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the first [saving throw](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#SavingThrow) for any effects of the new pipes, and this feature does not spend your bonus action.

### Pipes

Sets of pipes require attaching one at a time for use. **Your DM may provide more sets of pipes than those listed here.**

\column

Spells are never upcast when played from your _Warpipes_. DC for magical effects depend on the rarity of your instrument. If a spell cast with pipes requires [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Concentration), you must continue playing those pipes to maintain it. The spell ends if you stop playing for any reason.

### Upgrading Your Instrument

Increasing the rarity of _Warpipes_ is a large task not achievable by a single crafter. Your instrument is a complex maneuver of wood, leather, fabric, metal, and magic. Seek out suitable artisans, and it never hurts to get a _cleric&rsquo;s_ or _patron&rsquo;s_ blessing.

You may not upgrade the rarity of your _Warpipes_ without approval by the DM.

#### Time and Cost

Upgrading the rarity of your _Warpipes_ requires the same cost and tools as crafting a magic item from scratch. With required assistance the time is 1/2 that of for crafting a magic item from scratch. For upgrading to _Rare_ or greater rarity, your DM may require hard-to-find materials.

\column

#### Artisan Assistance

Upgrading _Warpipes_ needs collaboration. In addition to your own crafting skills, the help of other artisans is needed.

| Old Rarity | New Rarity | Artisans | Crafts |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|--|
| Common | Uncommon | 1 | _Leatherworker_, _Metalsmith_, _Tailor_, _Tinker_ or _Woodcarver_ |
| Uncommon | Rare | 2 | _Leatherworker_, _Metalsmith_, _Tailor_, _Tinker_ or _Woodcarver_ |
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 1 | _Alchemist_, _Calligrapher_ or _Painter_, _Jeweler_ |
| Rare | Very Rare | 3 | _Leatherworker_, _Metalsmith_, _Tailor_, _Tinker_ or _Woodcarver_ |
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 2 | _Alchemist_, _Calligrapher_ or _Painter_, _Jeweler_ |

_**Alchemist.**_ An Alchemist can create special oils and resins to treat woods and fabrics, making them resistant to fire, rot, or magical corruption. This treatment is crucial for the instrument's survival in perilous conditions.

_**Calligrapher or Painter.**_ A master of these can adorn the instrument with delicate runes or symbols of power. These are not merely decorative; they can be imbued with minor spells or blessings that the wielder can call upon.

_**Jeweler.**_ A Jeweler can inlay your instrument with precisely matched gemstones. These gems can serve as arcane foci, extra storage for magical charges, or show the presence of nearby magic or enemies.

_**Leatherworker.**_ The instrument&rsquo;s lungs is the leather Bag. Typically sheepskin or cow, an upgrade might need magical hide such as that of a _Displacer Beast_ or _Yeth Hound_.

_**Metalsmith,**_ Parts such as ferrules (metal rings to prevent the wood-splitting) or mounts (for pipe attachments) require this artisan. For a greater upgrades you might need mithral or inscribed runes of power.

_**Tailor.**_ Covering the Bag is a public face and protective layer. This artisan crafts an ornate cover from fine fabrics embroidering it with meaningful symbols and tassles. More powerful instruments_ may use spider silk or threads of pure metal.

_**Tinker.**_ Without this artisan and their precision, you may struggle to keep stocks airtight or the blowpipe valve from failing. And they may add their own magical touches.

_**Woodcarver.**_ The instrument&rsquo;s heart is in the delicate reeds providing the distinctive character to your instrument. This is apparent in chanter, drones, and wooden sets of pipes. Rare woods like _Ironwood_ or a branch from a _Feywild_ tree may resonate better.
