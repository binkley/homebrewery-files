# Warpipes

_Wondrous Item, varies (requires attunement by a creature proficient with bagpipes)_

These battle bagpipes were carried by others before and are as potent as any sword or bow or spell. Their lineage is as old as yours, and allies know to respect them or duck. Ever feared is the performer for braw or woe.

{{note

##### Choose Your Pipes

This dumpy bag with tubes sticking out is never the same. You may change pipes as needed for different tones, tunes, pitches and effects, and the instrument grows with you in power. When equipped, standard musical pipes are attached and may include additional sets of pipes.
}}

To use effects of the Warpipes, you must use your _Action_ and proficiency in [bagpipes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/463-bagpipes) to play the instrument. You can also play them as simple bagpipes:

**Utilize:** Play a known tune (DC 10), or improvise a song (DC 15)

#### Charges and Rarity

The power the instrument depends on its rarity and the sets of pipes. The pipes regain all expended charges after you finish a _Long Rest_.
- **Common.** There is 1 charge and is found with at least 2 sets of pipes.
- **Uncommon.** There are 3 charges and is found with at least 4 sets of pipes.
- **Rare.** There are 5 charges and is found with at least 6 sets of pipes.
- **Very Rare.** There are 7 charges and is found with at least 8 sets of pipes.

#### Warming Up

The _Warpipes_ possess minor magics that do not require charges. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

As an _Action_, you can rehearse a continuous drone for the flow of battle, lasting until the start of your next turn. While your warming-up tones are active, you can use your _Reaction_ to make a sharp note for a creature you can see within 60 feet.

That note affects an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make. You choose whether to add a d4 to or subtract a d4 from the roll. You can use this _Reaction_ after the d20 is rolled, but before the outcome is determined.

#### Changing the Tune

You can use a _Bonus Action_ to replace pipes. If an ally within 5 feet can see you changing pipes, they can assist as a _Reaction_ &mdash; no longer requiring your _Bonus Action_. That ally gains _Advantage_ on _saving throws_ for any effects of the new pipes.

### Pipes

Some _Warpipes_ are found with sets of pipes included. Other sets of pipes are found while adventuring. Each _Warpipes_ instrument may have different sets of pipes and more rare instruments may have less common pipes.

| Rarity | Always Included |
|:-:|--|
| Common | Pipes of Blessing |
| Uncommon| ?? |
| Rare | ?? |
| Very Rare | Pipes of Pain |

#### Pipes of Blessing

You play a long drone note and hopeful melody for up to 1 minute with _Concentration_. While you play this on the _Warpipes_, it has the same effect as the [Bless](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Bless) spell, and you choose targets at the start of your performance.

### Louder and Longer

Upgrading a set of _Warpipes_ is a large task, rarely achievable by a single crafter. The instrument is a complex maneuver of wood, leather, fabric, metal, and magic. To upgrade your _Warpipes_, seek out suitable artisans. It never hurts to get a _Cleric&rsquo;s_ blessing.

You may not upgrade the rarity of your _Warpipes_ without approval by the DM.

#### Artisan Assistance

As you upgrade your _Warpipes_ you need the assistance of others. In addition to your own crafting skills, seek the help of other artisans.

| Old Rarity | New Rarity | Artisans | Crafts |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|--|
| Common | Uncommon | 1 | _Leatherworker_, _Metalsmith_, _Tailor_, _Tinker_ or _Woodcarver_ |
| Uncommon | Rare | 2 | _Leatherworker_, _Metalsmith_, _Tailor_, _Tinker_ or _Woodcarver_ |
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 1 | _Alchemist_, _Calligrapher_ or _Painter_, _Jeweler_ |
| Rare | Very Rare | 3 | _Leatherworker_, _Metalsmith_, _Tailor_, _Tinker_ or _Woodcarver_ |
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; | 2 | _Alchemist_, _Calligrapher_ or _Painter_, _Jeweler_ |
| Very Rare | Legendary | 4 | _Leatherworker_, _Metalsmith_, _Tailor_, _Tinker_ or _Woodcarver_ |

_**Alchemist:**_ An Alchemist can create special oils and resins to treat woods and fabrics, making them resistant to fire, rot, or magical corruption. This treatment is crucial for the instrument's survival in perilous conditions.

_**Calligrapher / Painter:**_ A master of these can adorn the instrument with delicate runes or symbols of power. These are not merely decorative; they can be imbued with minor spells or blessings that the wielder can call upon.

_**Jeweler:**_ A Jeweler can inlay your _Warpipes_ with precisely matched gemstones. These gems can serve as arcane foci, extra storage for magical charges, or show the presence of nearby magic or enemies.

_**Leatherworker:**_ The instrument&rsquo;s lungs is the leather Bag. Typically sheepskin or cow, an upgrade might need magical hide, such as that of a _Displacer Beast_, to contain volatile energies.

_**Metalsmith:**_ Parts such as ferrules (metal rings to prevent the wood-splitting) or mounts (for pipe attachments) require this artisan. For a greater upgrades, you might need mithral or inscribed runes of power.

_**Tailor:**_ Covering the Bag is a public face and protective layer. This artisan crafts an ornate cover from fine fabrics embroidering it with meaningful symbols and tassles. More powerful _Warpipes_ may use spider silk or threads of pure silver.

_**Tinker:**_ Without this artisan and their precision, you may struggle to keep stocks airtight or the blowpipe valve from failing. And they love adding their own magical touches.

_**Woodcarver:**_ The instrument&rsquo;s heart is in the delicate reeds providing the distinctive character to your instrument. This is apparent in chanter, drones, and wooden sets of pipes. Rare woods like Ironwood or a branch from a Feywild tree may better resonate to your magical tones.
