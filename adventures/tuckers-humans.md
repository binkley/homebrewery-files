# Tucker&rsquo;s Humans

A reverse of the _Dungeon Crawl_ for powerful characters based on the famous
_Tucker&rsquo;s Kobolds_ from [_Dragon
127_](https://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/TuckersKobolds.pdf), a
popular tournament dungeon updated for D&amp;D 5e. _This_ adventure plays
characters as the defenders.

## Setup

Many _Small_ species delegates are invited to a Kobold warren to address the
"Human threat"&mdash;those of Medium or greater
[size](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Size) who
invade the lands of each of you. You are on the verge of a mutual defense
understanding when Big Folk invade this Kobold warren where you meet.

Each delegate (character) is given a [Silvered Bone
Whistle](./magic-items/silvered-bone-whistle.md). With it you can call a
_Kobold squad_ to your aid and [command](./feats/warren-commander.md) them.
