# Scribe&rsquo;s Supplies

*Wondrous Item, Common (requires proficiency with Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies)*

This lacquered case contains inkpots, quills and sheets of paper. To most, it functions as ordinary **Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies**. To one trained in the scribe&rsquo;s art, however, the tools reveal subtle enchantments.

Different inks, quills and papers within the kit may carry magical properties. Otherwise, the supplies function as **Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies** for all checks and crafting uses.

#### Special Quill

The kit contains an ornate quill that never dulls and is attuned to the supplies. The magical properties of the inks and papers function only when you write with this quill or another quill from this kit.

#### Inkpots

Every inkpot has different types of ink and refills after a long rest. Ink from an inkpot becomes ordinary unless drawn with a quill from these supplies.

- **Bountiful Ink.** This inkpot never runs dry and provides mundane ink in any color you choose.
- **Hesitant Ink.** This inkpot is for tentative writing and runs dry after first use. As an action, you can erase mundane writing created with its ink since your last long rest. The chosen writing must be visible and within 30 feet of you. This feature can't erase magical writing, such as spell scrolls or glyphs.
- **Interpreting Ink.** This inkpot is for translations and runs dry after first use. When read, the writng rearranges itself into the language of the reader.
- **Invisible Ink.** This inkpot is for hidden writing and runs dry after first use. As an action, you can write invisibly with this ink though a faint lemony scent lingers. Writing made this way remains invisible until revealed by heat, such as being held near a flame. The effect applies only to mundane writing, not magical script such as spell scrolls or glyphs.

#### Quills

- **Learned Quill.** This quill adds commentary. While you write, side annotations appear in the margins, automatically noting rumors or lore for subjects it finds interesting.
- **Suggestive Quill.** This quill is compulsive. Text written with this quill can subtly compel a reader to follow its written instruction.

#### Paper

- **Paired Paper.** This paper is for ranged communication. Writing on one sheet appears instantly on its paired sheet.
- **Vocal Paper.** This paper is for the illetrate. When opened or touched, pages speaks their contents aloud in the language they were written in.
