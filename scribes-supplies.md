# Scribe&rsquo;s Supplies

*Wondrous Item, Common (requires proficiency with Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies)*

This lacquered case contains inkpots, quills and sheets of paper. To most, it functions as ordinary **Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies**. To one trained in the scribe&rsquo;s art, however, the tools reveal subtle enchantments.

Different inks, quills and papers within the kit may carry magical properties. Otherwise, the supplies function as **Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies** for all checks and crafting uses.

#### Special Quill

The kit contains an ornate quill that never dulls and is attuned to the supplies. The magical properties of the inks and papers function only when you write with this quill or another quill from this kit.

#### Combining Supplies

You can use more than one type of supply (ink, quill, or paper) for a document, but you can't combine two supplies of the same type on the same page. For example, you might switch quills mid-document, or change inks when starting a new page, but you can't layer two magical inks on the same sheet.

If a page is written with more than one magical supply of the same type, the DM decides which effect prevails, or whether the magic fails entirely.

Casting _Detect Magic_ or similar effects on writings made with these supplies reveals a general sense of effects on each page from inks, quills or paper used.

#### Inks

Every inkpot refills after a Long Rest and each ink is in its own pot. Ink becomes mundane unless applied with a quill from this kit.

- **Bountiful Ink.** _Favored by artists, students and novices, this ink is colorful._
This inkpot never runs dry. It produces mundane ink in any color you choose. This is a common supply item.
- **Hesitant Ink.** _Favored for drafts and revisions, this light ink is never truly final._
This inkpot runs dry after first use. As an action, you can erase mundane writing created with it since your last Long Rest. The chosen writing must be visible and within 30 feet of you. Magical writing, such as spell scrolls or glyphs, is unaffected. This is a common supply item.
- **Interpreting Ink.** _Favored by diplomats, this ink is universally understood._
This inkpot runs dry after first use. Writing made with it rearranges itself into the language of the reader. This is an uncommon supply item.
- **Invisible Ink.** _Favored by spies and pranksters, this ink leaves only a faint lemony scent._
This inkpot runs dry after first use. As an action, you can write invisibly with this ink. Writing made this way remains invisible until revealed by heat, such as being held near a flame. The effect applies only to mundane writing, not magical text such as spell scrolls or glyphs. This is a common supply item.

#### Quills

- **Chameleon Quill.** _Favored by nobles and counterfeiters, this quill writes in another&rsquo;s hand._
When you write with this quill, the handwriting matches the style of any sample you’ve seen within the last 24 hours. This is an uncommon supply item.
- **Learned Quill.** _Favored by scholars and the curious, this quill adds commentary._
When you write with this quill, margin notes appear, automatically recording rumors or lore related to subjects you mention. This is a rare supply item.
- **Suggestive Quill.** _Favored by the bossy, this quill&rsquo;s words urge obedience._
When you write with this quill, a short command can subtly compel a reader to follow its written instruction. This is a rare supply item.

#### Paper

- **Enduring Paper.** _Favored by archivists and travelers, this parchment mocks fire and flood._
Writing on this paper can't be damaged by fire or water, and the sheet doesn’t deteriorate with age. This is an uncommon supply item.
- **Paired Paper.** _Favored by remote penpals, these blue sheets reach to their twins._
Writing on one sheet of this paper appears instantly on its paired sheet within the same plane. This is an uncommon supply item.
- **Vocal Paper.** _Favored by illiterate readers, this paper speaks its words._
When a sheet of this paper is opened or touched, it speaks its contents aloud in the language they were written in. This is an uncommon supply item.
