# Scribe&rsquo;s Supplies

*Wondrous Item, Common (requires proficiency with Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies)*

This lacquered case contains inkpots, quills and sheets of paper. To most, it functions as ordinary **Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies**. To one trained in the scribe&rsquo;s art, however, the tools reveal subtle enchantments.

Different inks, quills and papers within the kit may carry magical properties. Otherwise, the supplies function as **Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies** for all checks and crafting uses.

#### Inkpots

Every inkpot has different types of ink and refills after a long rest. Ink from an inkpot becomes ordinary unless drawn with a quill from these supplies.

- **Bountiful Ink.** This inkpot never runs dry and provides mundane ink in any color you choose.
- **Hesitant Ink.** This inkpot is for tentative writing and runs dry after first use. You can use an action to erase mundane writing created with its ink since your last long rest. The chosen writing must be visible and within 30 feet of you. This feature can't erase magical writing, such as spell scrolls or glyphs.
- **Invisible Ink.** This inkpot is for hidden writing and runs dry after first use. You can use an action to write invisibly with this ink though a faint lemony scent lingers. Writing made this way remains invisible until revealed by heat, such as being held near a flame. The effect applies only to mundane writing, not magical script such as spell scrolls or glyphs.
