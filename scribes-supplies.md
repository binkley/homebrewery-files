# Scribe&rsquo;s Supplies

_Wondrous ![alt-text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binkley/homebrewery-files/main/quill-and-inkpot.png) {width:6em,float:right} Item, varies (requires attunement by a Humanoid proficient with Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies)_

{{note
##### More Than One Item

This black, red and gold ornamented lacquered case marked as _Scribe’s Supplies_ is never quite the same as another. One might hold inks that vanish, papers that sing, quills that cut. This item comes in multiple rarities, and rolls on supply tables for inks, quills or papers. Apprentice, Journeyman and Expert Supplies are kin, no two likely the same.
}}

_**Magical Supplies.**_ The inks, quills and papers in these supplies carry magical properties beyond their mundane use. Otherwise, they function as _Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies_ for checks and crafting. If lost, stolen or destroyed, they can be replaced with suitable mundane tools and waiting 1 day.

_**Limited Use.**_ Unless noted, each supply item can create one magical effect per [Long Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#LongRest). Afterward, pages, writings or markings become mundane but keep any words or symbols you made. After a Long Rest the supplies restore themselves: inkpots refill, quills resharpen, and sheaves replenish. Magical effects don't function with inks, quills or papers from other sources.

_**Time Spent.**_ Writing a page&mdash;magical or mundane&mdash;takes 1 minute of [_Concentration_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Concentration). If your concentration is broken, the page becomes mundane and ruined, and any supply items used are expended.

#### Epistolist

These supplies include a mundane inexhaustible inkpot, quill and sheaf of paper, sufficient for writing letters or crafting a [_Spell Scroll_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9229085-spell-scroll) by the normal rules. When doing so, you may add magical supply items. The maximum spell level depends on rarity (see the _Rarity and Contents_ table). Using supply items to craft resolves first to the writer&rsquo;s order of supplies, then the spell. The spell itself is always cast normally.

#### Combining Supplies

You can use more than one type of supply item on a page, but you can't combine two of the same type. For example, if you switch quills mid-page, the second is mundane for that page and doesn't expend a use.

#### Adding Supplies

Supply items can be added to these supplies by following the rules for crafting magic items, provided the crafter has the necessary proficiency and resources. Each inkpot, quill or page of parchment lists its rarity. Adding a supply item does not change the rarity of this item as a whole, and does not allow rerolls on the supply tables.

### Rarity and Contents

Different rarities of _Scribe&rsquo;s Supplies_ increase in magical power while not restricting mundane use. Daily use of magical supplies is capped, and _Spell Scroll_ crafting is limited for incorporating unique inks, quills, or paper but not for mundane spell scribing with these supplies.

#### Inks

Magical properties function only when the ink is used by a quill from these supplies.

_**Bountiful Ink (Common).**_
_Favored by artists, students and novices, this ink is colorful._
This inkpot never runs dry. It produces mundane ink in any color you choose.

_**Explosive Ink (Rare).**_
_Favored by saboteurs, this ink hides a trap in words._
When a creature reads the writing, the ink explodes in flame. The reader and all creatures within 10 feet of it must make a DC 15 Dexterity [_saving throw_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#SavingThrow), taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The page is destroyed.

_**Illusory Ink (Rare).**_
_Favored by deceivers, this ink one message within another._
Writing made with this ink creates the illusion of any text or image the writer describes. A creature that reads the page must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom [_saving throw_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#SavingThrow) or believe the illusory writing is genuine. On a success, the creature recognizes the writing as illusory, and reads the true writing. The effect applies only to mundane writing, not magical text such as spell scrolls or glyphs.

_**Interpreting Ink (Uncommon).**_
_Favored by diplomats, this ink is universally understood._
Writing made with it rearranges itself into the language of the reader.

_**Invisible Ink (Common).**_
_Favored by spies and pranksters, this ink leaves only a faint lemony scent._
As an action, you can write invisibly with this ink. Writing made this way remains invisible until revealed by heat, such as being held near a flame. The effect applies only to mundane writing, not magical text such as spell scrolls or glyphs.

_**Sleeping Ink (Rare).**_
_Favored by mystics, this ink bleeds into dreams._
Writing made with this ink appears in the dreams of any creature that possesses the page each time it sleeps for 7 nights. The dream is fully recalled upon waking. After 7 dreams by any creature, the ink becomes mundane and no longer causes dreams. If the writing describes creatures, places, or objects, the dream includes visions of them. The dream reflects the tone of the writing&mdash;pleasant dreams for pleasant words, harsh words lead to nightmares. At the DM&rsquo;s discretion, dreams may produce minor effects upon waking, such as granting 5 temporary hit points, imposing a DC 13 Wisdom [_saving throw_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#SavingThrow) against 1 level of [_Exhaustion_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition), granting [_advantage_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Advantage) on checks related to a place dreamt of, revealing hints toward the location of an object, or similar results.

_**Vanishing Ink (Uncommon).**_
_Favored by charlatans, scouts and smugglers, this ink goes away._
Writing made with this ink fades after 1 hour. The text reappears only under moonlight or with magical detection (such as [_Detect Magic_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#DetectMagic)). Magical writing, such as spell scrolls or glyphs, is unaffected.

#### Quills

_**Chameleon Quill (Uncommon).**_
_Favored by nobles and counterfeiters, this quill writes in another&rsquo;s hand._
When you write with this quill, the handwriting matches the style of any sample you’ve seen within the last 24 hours.

_**Learned Quill (Rare).**_
_Favored by scholars and the curious, this quill adds commentary._
When you write with this quill, margin notes appear, automatically recording rumors or lore related to subjects you mention.

_**Memory Quill (Common).**_
_Favored by diarists and dreamers, this quill turns thoughts into recollections on the page._
When you write with this quill, the words capture a memory or idea you focus on. A creature reading the page experiences faint images and sounds in their mind, as if recalling a dream, which lasts only while the page is read.

_**Sharp Quill (Rare).**_
_Favored by duelists and assassins, this quill is mightier than the dagger._
This quill functions as a mundane writing tool or as a magic dagger (1d4 piercing damage, finesse, light, thrown 20/60 ft.). While you are attuned to these supplies, you can command this quill to fly and fight as a _Dancing Sword_, except it uses the statistics of a dagger instead of a longsword.

_**Suggestive Quill (Rare).**_
_Favored by the bossy, this quill&rsquo;s words urge obedience._
When you write with this quill, a short command can subtly compel a reader to follow its written instruction.

#### Paper

Every sheaf of paper contains 10 sheets. Magical properties function only when the paper is marked on with quill and ink from these supplies.

_**Binding Paper (Rare).**_
_Favored by magistrates and devils, this parchment enforces oaths._
Any contract written on this paper becomes magically binding if all parties sign it voluntarily. A creature that knowingly breaks the terms must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each Long Rest or take 2d6 psychic damage. This damage continues each day until the terms are fulfilled or the page is destroyed. Casting [_Remove Curse_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#RemoveCurse), [_Greater Restoration_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#GreaterRestoration), or similar magic ends the contract without harming the paper.

\page

_**Field Note (Common).**_
_Favored by scouts and sergeants, this brief page is meant for quick reference._
When a creature uses a bonus action to read this page, it prepares to attack. Until the start of its next turn, it has [_advantage_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Advantage) on its first [_attack roll_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#AttackRoll).

_**Mimeograph Paper (Uncommon).**_
_Favored by calligraphers and copyists, these blue pages echo every stroke of the quill._
When you write on a page of this paper, the same writing is duplicated simultaneously on as many unused pages from the same sheaf as you choose. These copies are aromatic and smudged blue, and each page used in this way is expended. All pages must be within 5 feet of you. Creating copies is a single use of the supplies regardless of copied page count. You cannot copy magical writings.

_**Mirror Paper (Rare).**_
_Favored by the nosy, this glossy page reflects more than words._
The first creature that reads the writing or markings on a page must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or it becomes the subject of the _Scrying_ spell. The spell requires no components, lasts for 10 minutes, and doesn't use a spell slot.

_**Origami Paper (Uncommon).**_
_Favored by entertainers and spies, this page folds itself into living shapes._
As an action, the page folds into a Tiny paper creature of a form chosen by the writer (such as a flower, bird, or insect). The creature has AC 8, 1 hit point, and a Speed of 20 feet, fly 20 feet. The reader can direct the creature’s movement as a bonus action. The creature lasts for 1 hour, or until it is destroyed or unfolded, after which it becomes a mundane sheet of paper.

_**Paired Paper (Uncommon).**_
_Favored by remote penpals, these pale pages reach to their twins._
This sheaf is 5 sets of paired pages. When you write or mark on a page of this paper, those appears instantly on its paired page within the same plane.

_**Research Paper (Common).**_
_Favored by apprentices and investigators, this page distills insights into practice._
When you write on this page, you must specify one [_Ability_](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#AbilityScoreandModifier) (such as Strength or others). When a creature reads the page before making a related ability check or skill check, it can roll a d4 and add it to the result.

_**Trailblazer Map (Uncommon).**_
_Favored by scouts and couriers, these notes sketch the way forward._
When you write the name of a specific place or landmark within 3 miles (such as &ldquo;City of Greyhawk&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wizard&rsquo;s Tower&rdquo;), the page orients itself and draws a faint, shifting outline showing the quickest route considering terrain. The map is vague, hinting at direction rather than detail, and updates as you travel. This paper cannot locate creatures or unspecified objects (such as &ldquo;the nearest obelisk&rdquo;). It functions on land or sea, but not underground or across planar boundaries.

_**Vocal Paper (Uncommon).**_
_Favored by illiterate readers, this paper speaks its words._
When a page is opened or touched, it speaks its contents aloud in the language it was written in.

_**Warped Paper (Rare).**_
_Favored by close allies and tricksters, this cockled sheet bends space and words._
When a creature willingly reads a page, the reader and the writer instantly swap places, provided they are on the same plane of existence and within 1 mile of each other. Both creatures arrive safely in each other&rsquo;s space. If the swap would place either creature into an occupied space too small for it, the swap fails and the paper crumbles to ash. Any grapple affecting either creature ends when the swap occurs.
