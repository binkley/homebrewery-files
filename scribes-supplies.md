# Scribe&rsquo;s Supplies

_Wondrous Item, varies (requires attunement by a Humanoid proficient with Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies)_

This black, red and gold ornamented lacquered case contains inkpots, quills, and sheaves of paper. To most, it functions as ordinary **Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies**. To one proficient and attuned, however, the tools reveal subtle magics and hint at greater secrets. These supplies can create magical pages, writings and markings.

_**Magical Supplies.**_ Different inks, quills and papers in these supplies carry magical properties in addition to their mundane use. Otherwise, the item functions as **Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies** for all checks and crafting.

_**Limited Use.**_ Unless otherwise noted, each supply item can be used to create a magical effect once per Long Rest. After the effect occurs, a page, writing or marking becomes mundane but retains any words or symbols you made.

_**Time Spent.**_ Writing a page with these tools&mdash;whether magical or mundane&mdash;takes 1 minute of _Concentration_. If your concentration is broken, the page is mundane and ruined, and expends any supply items involved.

#### Special Quill

The kit contains an ornate quill that never dulls and is attuned to the supplies. The magical properties of the inks and papers function only when you write with this quill or another quill from this kit. If this quill is lost, stolen or destroyed, you can replace it by spending a day with another suitable quill.

#### Combining Supplies

You can use more than one type of supply item for a document, but you can't combine two supplies of the same type on the same page. For example, you might switch quills mid-document or change inks for a new page, but you can't layer their effects on the same page.

#### Adding Supplies

Supply items can be added to these supplies by following the rules for crafting magic items, provided the crafter has the necessary proficiency and resources. Each inkpot, quill or page of parchment lists its rarity. Adding a supply item does not change the rarity of this item as a whole, and does not allow rerolls on the supply tables.

### Rarity and Contents

Different rarities of _Scribe&rsquo;s Supplies_ contain an increasing number of magical supply items. The number of magical pages or markings you can create each Long Rest also scales with rarity. Mundane uses are unlimited.

#### Inks

Every inkpot refills after a Long Rest and each ink is in its own pot. Ink becomes mundane unless applied with a quill from this kit.

_**Bountiful Ink.**_
_Favored by artists, students and novices, this ink is colorful._
This inkpot never runs dry. It produces mundane ink in any color you choose. This is a common supply item.

_**Explosive Ink.**_
_Favored by saboteurs, this ink hides a trap in words._
When a creature reads the writing, the ink explodes in flame. The reader and all creatures within 10 feet of it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The page is destroyed. This is a rare supply item.

_**Hesitant Ink.**_
_Favored for drafts and revisions, this light ink is never truly final._
As an action, you can erase mundane writing created with it since your last Long Rest. The chosen writing must be visible and within 30 feet of you. Magical writing, such as spell scrolls or glyphs, is unaffected. This is a common supply item.

_**Illusory Ink.**_
_Favored by deceivers, this ink one message within another._
Writing made with this ink creates the illusion of any text or image the writer describes. A creature that reads the page must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or believe the illusory writing is genuine. On a success, the creature recognizes the writing as illusory, and reads the true writing. The effect applies only to mundane writing, not magical text such as spell scrolls or glyphs. This is a rare supply item.

_**Interpreting Ink.**_
_Favored by diplomats, this ink is universally understood._
Writing made with it rearranges itself into the language of the reader. This is an uncommon supply item.

_**Invisible Ink.**_
_Favored by spies and pranksters, this ink leaves only a faint lemony scent._
As an action, you can write invisibly with this ink. Writing made this way remains invisible until revealed by heat, such as being held near a flame. The effect applies only to mundane writing, not magical text such as spell scrolls or glyphs. This is a common supply item.

_**Sleeping Ink.**_
_Favored by mystics, this ink bleeds into dreams._
Writing made with this ink appears in the dreams of any creature that possesses the page each time it sleeps for 7 nights. The dream is fully recalled upon waking. After 7 dreams by any creature, the ink becomes mundane and no longer causes dreams. If the writing describes creatures, places, or objects, the dream includes visions of them. The dream reflects the tone of the writing&mdash;pleasant dreams for pleasant words, harsh words lead to nightmares. At the DM&rsquo;s discretion, dreams may produce minor effects upon waking, such as granting 5 temporary hit points, imposing a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw against 1 level of Exhaustion, granting advantage on checks related to a place dreamt of, revealing hints toward the location of an object, or similar results. This is a rare supply item.

_**Vanishing Ink.**_
_Favored by charlatans, scouts and smugglers, this ink goes away._
Writing made with this ink fades after 1 hour. The text reappears only under moonlight or with magical detection (such as _Detect Magic_). Magical writing, such as spell scrolls or glyphs, is unaffected. This is an uncommon supply item.

#### Quills

_**Chameleon Quill.**_
_Favored by nobles and counterfeiters, this quill writes in another&rsquo;s hand._
When you write with this quill, the handwriting matches the style of any sample you’ve seen within the last 24 hours. This is an uncommon supply item.

_**Learned Quill.**_
_Favored by scholars and the curious, this quill adds commentary._
When you write with this quill, margin notes appear, automatically recording rumors or lore related to subjects you mention. This is a rare supply item.

_**Memory Quill.**_
_Favored by diarists and dreamers, this quill turns thoughts into recollections on the page._
When you write with this quill, the words capture a memory or idea you focus on. A creature reading the page experiences faint images and sounds in their mind, as if recalling a dream, which lasts only while the page is read. This is a common supply item.

_**Sharp Quill.**_
_Favored by duelists and assassins, this quill is mightier than the dagger._
This quill functions as a mundane writing tool or as a magic dagger (1d4 piercing damage, finesse, light, thrown 20/60 ft.). While you are attuned to these _Scribe&rsquo;s Supplies_, you can command this quill to fly and fight as a _Dancing Sword_, except it uses the statistics of a dagger instead of a longsword.

_**Suggestive Quill.**_
_Favored by the bossy, this quill&rsquo;s words urge obedience._
When you write with this quill, a short command can subtly compel a reader to follow its written instruction. This is a rare supply item.

#### Paper

Every sheaf of paper contains 10 sheets. At the end of a Long Rest, each sheaf regains all expended sheets, restoring it to 10. Magical properties function only when the paper is written on with a quill from this kit. Any unused sheets beyond this number lose their magic and become mundane.

_**Binding Paper.**_
_Favored by magistrates and devils, this parchment enforces oaths._
Any contract written on this paper becomes magically binding if all parties sign it voluntarily. A creature that knowingly breaks the terms must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each Long Rest or take 2d6 psychic damage. This damage continues each day until the terms are fulfilled or the page is destroyed. Casting *Remove Curse*, *Greater Restoration*, or similar magic ends the contract without harming the paper. This is a rare supply item.

_**Mimeograph Paper.**_ _Favored by calligraphers and copyists, these blue sheets echo every stroke of the quill._
When you write on a sheet of this paper, the writing simultaneously appear on up to 9 other sheets from the same sheaf within 5 feet of you. This is an uncommon supply item.

_**Mirror Paper.**_
_Favored by the nosey, this glossy sheet reflects more than words._
This sheet can be used once and becomes mundane afterward, keeping any writing on it. The first creature that reads the writing must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be placed under the effect of the _Scrying_ spell, targeting the writer as the subject. The spell requires no components, lasts for 10 minutes, and doesn't use a spell slot. This is a rare supply item.

_**Origami Paper.**_
_Favored by entertainers and spies, this sheet folds itself into living shapes._
As an action, the sheet folds into a Tiny paper creature of a form chosen by the writer (such as a flower, bird, or insect). The creature has AC 8, 1 hit point, and a Speed of 20 feet, fly 20 feet. The reader can direct the creature’s movement as a bonus action. The creature lasts for 1 hour, or until it is destroyed or unfolded, after which it becomes a mundane sheet of paper. This is an uncommon supply item.

_**Paired Paper.**_
_Favored by remote penpals, these blue sheets reach to their twins._
Writing on one sheet of this paper appears instantly on its paired sheet within the same plane. This is an uncommon supply item.

_**Research Paper.**_
_Favored by apprentices and investigators, this page distills insights into practice._
When you write on this page, you must note an ability (such as Strength, Intelligence or any of the six). When a creature reads the page before making a related ability or skill check, it can roll a d4 and add it to the result. This is a common supply item.

_**Research Paper.**_
_Favored by apprentices and investigators, this page distills insights into practice._
When you write on this page, you must specify one ability (such as Strength or others). When a creature reads the page before making a related ability check or skill check, it can roll a d4 and add it to the result. This is a common supply item.

_**Sealed Paper.**_
_Favored for contracts and decrees, this parchment resists tampering._
Writing on this paper can’t be erased, smudged, or altered by mundane means. Magical alterations (such as _Dispel Magic_ or _Wish_) may still affect it at DM discretion. This is an uncommon supply item.

_**Vocal Paper.**_
_Favored by illiterate readers, this paper speaks its words._
When a sheet of this paper is opened or touched, it speaks its contents aloud in the language they were written in. This is an uncommon supply item.

_**Warped Paper.**_
_Favored by close allies and tricksters, this cockled sheet bends space and words._
This sheet can be used once and becomes mundane afterward, keeping any writing on it. When a creature willingly reads the writing, the reader and the writer instantly swap places, provided they are on the same plane of existence and within 1 mile of each other. Both creatures arrive safely in each other&rsquo;s space. If the swap would place either creature into an occupied space too small for it, the swap fails and the paper crumbles to ash. Any grapple affecting either creature ends when the swap occurs. This is a rare supply item.
