# Scribe&rsquo;s Supplies

*Wondrous Item, Common (requires proficiency with Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies)*

This lacquered case contains quills, an inkpot, and sheets of parchment. To most, it functions as ordinary **Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies**. To one trained in the scribe&rsquo;s art, however, the tools reveal a subtle enchantment.

- **Bountiful Inkpot.** The inkpot never runs dry and produces ink in any color you choose.
- **Ephemeral Script.** Once per long rest while holding the inkpot, you can use an action to cause mundane writing made with these supplies since your last long rest to fade harmlessly, leaving the pages clean. The writing must be within 30 feet of you and visible. This feature canâ€™t erase magical writing, such as spell scrolls or glyphs.

Otherwise, the supplies function as **Calligrapher&rsquo;s Supplies** for all checks and crafting uses.
