# War Mattock of Mining

_Martial melee weapon, uncommon_

- **Damage:** 1d8 piercing (1d10)
- **Properties:** Sap, Versatile (1d10)
- **Weight:** 4 lbs.

The thick hickory haft of this heavy mattock is topped by a dangerous head of dark lodestone-iron forged and honed with great skill.

A war mattock is similar to a [war pick](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/32-war-pick) and better suited for surface work. Using this item as a weapon requires proficiency in _War Pick_ and can always be used as a mundane work item.

You can cast the [Earth Tremor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2378-earth-tremor) or [Mold Earth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2394-mold-earth) spells with this mattock as a magic action. This weapon has 2 charges, which you can expend to cast spells from it. It regains all expended charges when you finish a Long Rest.

{note}
Both _Earth Tremor_ and _Mold Earth_ spells are from other published works and
not in the SRD.
{note}

Each spell has a charge cost:

| Charge Cost | Spell |
|:--:|:--|
| 1 | [Mold Earth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2394-mold-earth) |
| 2 | [Earth Tremor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2378-earth-tremor) |

Proficiency with a _War Pick_ allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with the _War Mattock of Mining_.

#### Weapon Mastery

**Sap.** If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.
