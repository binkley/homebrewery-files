# Goliath Ancestry â€” Ettin

Of Two Minds (Ettin)

**Prerequisite**: Goliath species

In addition to other feats taken at 1st level, as a Goliath you may take this feat as a replacement for the _Giant Ancestry_ feature.

{{note
Born of an Ettin bloodline&mdash;giant-kin with two heads sharing one body&mdash;you carry the will of two minds. You have uncanny mental resilience and can channel your strikes with both wills at once, though companions sometimes wonder that you argue with yourself.

#### Giant Ancestry

You can use the chosen benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

When you use this feature, choose one of the following benefits:
- **Twin Resolve.** _Two minds to affect, not one._ When you make a saving throw against an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma effect, or against a spell from the Enchantment school, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on the saving throw.
- **Twin Strike.** _Both minds strike as one._ When you hit a target with a weapon or spell attack and deal damage to it, you can use this feature (no action required) to deal an extra 1d4 psychic damage to that target, or change the damage type of that attack to psychic.
- **Twin Will.** _One mind protects the other._ When you take psychic damage, you can use your reaction to have resistance to that instance of damage.
