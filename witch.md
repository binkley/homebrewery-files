# The Witch
A D&D 5e (2024) spellcasting class. <br>
Not a Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, nor Wizard. Definitely not a martial. Someone to respect, listen to, and fear in confrontations.

Witches rarely choose the path of magic so much as they are chosen by it. Signs of a witch&rsquo;s calling can appear early: an uncanny knack for spotting soon breaking storms, animals treating you as an old friend, or your stubborn refusal to be overawed regardless of station. You may have lived apart from others but still in the community — learning, watching, and earning respect (or fear). Your magic comes from knowing people and the world as it actually is, and intuition and willpower.

A Witch&rsquo;s powers sway crowds and kingdoms, glimpse the future, drive creatures of field, forest, and water, and protect those around them. There is whimsy and unreality in their actions and spells. A witch&rsquo;s curse is _terrible_.

Most Witches are not taught in academies but by fellow Witches or through unexpected callings. Many live apart from the world, as village healers, wandering seers, or craggy hermits. Others hold court as matriarchs, midwives, folk queens, or figures of local legend. Above all, a Witch seeks _respect_.

### Becoming a Witch ...

#### As a Level 1 Character

- Gain all the tratis in the Core Witch Traits table.
- Gain the Witch&rsquo;s level 1 features, which are listed in the Witch Features table.

\column

#### As a Multiclass Character

- Gain the following traits from the Core Witch Traits table: Hit Point Die, proficiency in one skill of your choice, and proficiency with the Herbalism Kit.
- Gain the Witch&rsquo;s level 1 features, which are listed in the Witch Features table. See the multiclassing rules in the D&amp;D _Player&rsquo;s Handbook_ to determine your available spell slots.

### Witch Class Features

As a Witch, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Witch levels. These features are listed in the Witch Features table.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to draw from the land, necessity, and the teaching of other witches to cast spells. See the D&amp;D _Player&rsquo;s Handbook_ for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Witch spell, which appear in the Witch spell list later in the class&rsquo;s description.

Every spell includes a brief note on how Witches tend to use it. These notes don't change the spell&rsquo;s mechanics but suggest tone and roleplay. A Witch often adds a personal flavor to a spell without changing the magic.

_**Cantrips.**_
You know three cantrips of your choice from the Witch spell list.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Witch cantrip of your choice.  When you reach Witch levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Witch spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Witch Features table.

_**Spell Slots.**_
The Witch Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

_**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.**_
You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 spells from the Witch spell list.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Witch levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Witch Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Witch spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you&rsquo;re a level 3 Witch, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

\page

If another Witch feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Witch spells for you.

_**Spellcasting Ability.**_
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Witch spells.

_**Spellcasting Focus.**_
You can use a Druidic Focus, Herbalism Kit, or Cook&rsquo;s Utensils as a Spellcasting Focus for your Witch spells.

</div>

#### Level 1: Evil Eye

Witches say the eyes speak before the mouth does. A curse carried in a glance, stopping hearts, thoughts, and hands.

You learn the **Evil Eye** cantrip. It counts as a Witch cantrip for you and doesn't count against the number of cantrips you know. (The cantrip is described at the end.)

#### Level 1: Herbal Sage

Your understanding of plants and folk cures is guided by wisdom, not rote learning. You are wise in the ways of roots and remedies, leaves and mushrooms.

When using an _Herbalism Kit_, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Intelligence modifier for any ability checks made with the kit. You also add your proficiency bonus if you aren&rsquo;t already doing so.

In addition, you always have advantage on any ability check made using an _Herbalism Kit_.

#### Level 2: Cross Words

You learn the *Hex* spell. It is always prepared for you and doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare.

You can cast *Hex* without expending a spell slot using only verbal components. You can do so twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Casting with spell slots follows the normal rules for spell components.

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Witch levels:
- **5th level**: 3 uses
- **11th level**: 4 uses
- **17th level**: 5 uses

When you cast *Hex* using this feature, you can use your Cook&rsquo;s Utensils or Herbalism Kit as your spellcasting focus.

#### Level 2: Dangerous Familiar

You learn the *Find Familiar* spell. It is always prepared for you and doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare. You can cast it once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

When casting *Find Familiar* using this feature, you do so as a ritual. You may use an Herbalism Kit or Cook&rsquo;s Utensils as your spellcasting focus for the casting.

**Independent Spirit.**
Your familiar is unusually willful and assertive. It can take the **Attack action** on its turn. When it does, it makes a single attack that benefits from your proficiency bonus. On turns it attacks, the familiar can&rsquo;t cast spells or deliver your spells.

#### Level 2: Witch Armor

You could avoid fate this time. A subtle curse sends ill luck to your foes, causing blows to falter and spells to misfire.

When a creature you can see makes an attack roll or casts a spell that targets only you, you can use your reaction to impose **disadvantage** on that roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 3: Witch Subclass

You gain a Witch subclass of your choice.

#### Level 3: Second Sight

Your insight into others borders on the supernatural.

You gain proficiency in the _Insight_ skill. If you're already proficient in it, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it using your **expertise**.

\page

### Level 5: Coven Magic

> _Three stand beneath the moon. The spell is cast not alone, but in echo and accord._

Starting at 5th level, your connection to your coven &mdash; real or imagined &mdash; grants you insight into deeper rituals.

You automatically learn **Augury**, and it counts as a Witch spell for you. You can cast it **as a ritual only**, even if you don&rsquo;t have it prepared.

{note}
Bird flocks, tea leaves, lay of the cards &mdash;the auspices don't lie, they're only misread.
{note}

In addition, choose one other ritual spell from any full caster&rsquo;s spell list (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard) of 3rd level or lower. This spell counts as a Witch spell for you, and you can cast it **as a ritual only**, even if you don&rsquo;t have it prepared.

You may change this spell whenever you gain a level in this class, reflecting a shift in your coven&rsquo;s knowledge or priorities.

At higher levels, your coven&rsquo;s lore deepens:

| Witch Level | Ritual Spells Known | Max Spell Level |
|:-----------:|:-------------------:|:---------------:|
| 5           | 1                   | 3rd             |
| 9           | 2                   | 4th             |
| 13          | 3                   | 5th             |
| 17          | 4                   | 6th             |

You may only cast these spells as rituals. They do not count against your spells prepared.

When casting one of these rituals, you may use a **witch&rsquo;s focus** &mdash; an herbalism kit, cook&rsquo;s utensils, or druidic focus &mdash; in place of any material component that lacks a listed gold cost.

### Level 7: Witches Fly Free

You gain a **Broom of Flying**.

This is a powerful, storied magic item &mdash; some say too powerful. But when you need to be somewhere in a hurry, _flying_ is the only way to travel. It&rsquo;s amazing how much you can carry on a broom.

If you already possess this item, you are granted a different suitable magic item, chosen by the DM.

#### Difficult Customer

When haggling over other means of travel you have **advantage** on _Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion)_ checks. Witches rarely pay full price for themselves, and never twice.

### Level 9: Improved Familiar

When casting **Find Familiar** you may choose any creature of challenge rating 1 or lower.

#### Level 10: Witch&rsquo;s Insight

Your insight into fate and folly lets you tip the balance of events.

When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes a **D20 Test**, you can use your reaction to spend 1 use of this feature and impose **advantage** or **disadvantage** on that test. You must choose to do so **before** the roll is made.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your **proficiency bonus**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Witch Subclasses

You gain a Witch subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Witch levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass&rsquo;s features that are of your Witch level or lower.

### The Maiden
_Bright-eyed, underestimated, and full of wild potential_

#### Level 3: Inner Discovery

Your herbal knowledge or your voice borders on the supernatural.

You gain proficiency in your choice of the _Nature_ or _Performance_ skill.
If you are already proficient in the chosen skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses that skill (expertise).

#### Level 3: Maiden Spells

When you choose this Calling at 3rd level, you gain additional spells that reflect the wild, bright magic of youthful witches. These spells are always prepared and count as Witch spells for you. They do not count against the number of spells you can prepare.

| Witch Level | Spell |

| Witch Level | Spells |
|:--:|:--|
| 3           | *Beast Sense*, *Command*, *Counterspell*, *Enthrall*, *Phantasmal Force* |

| 9           | *Compulsion*, *Dominate Beast*, *Phantasmal Killer* |

- **Blight** <br>

- **Speak with Plants** <br>
  Whisper to leaves and roots; the green things of the world murmur back, gossiping about what they&rsquo;ve seen.

  A hallucination so real it can hurt. Fear, shame, fire, or memory might be what the target conjures.

- **Phantasmal Killer** <br>

- **Vampiric Touch** <br>

### Level 6: Borrowing

You inhabit the body of a natural creature for a limited time, and control it as your own.

You can cast a special form of **Magic Jar** on a non-hostile natural creature within range of your senses, and your body seems dead to others. The target does not make a saving throw. Its own body serves as the container for the spell and remains aware as a silent, non-hostile observer. The borrowed creature cannot be a sentient creature, and it must have an Intelligence score lower than 3.

You are limited to non-hostile _Beast_ or _Plant_ creatures lacking the **Swarm** trait. While in the borrowed form, you cannot take the **Attack** action.

If the creature is already possessed or protected by *Protection from Evil and Good*, *Magic Circle*, or similar magic, the borrowing fails. The target must have a challenge rating equal to or lower than your limit, as shown below.

\page

Others may make a skill check to recognize that your near-dead form still lives (DC 15). <br>
**TODO** Others that examine your body can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check (or Wisdom (Perception) at the DM’s discretion) to realize you are not dead, only absent.

Borrowing ends early if the borrowed creature is reduced to 0 hit points, you return to your own body. When this happens, you immediately return to your own body and fall **Prone** and **Incapacitated** until the end of your next turn.

If you borrow a creature for more than 1 hour, you gain 1 level of _Exhaustion_, and an additional level of exhaustion for each hour thereafter.

You may use this feature once, and regain its use when you finish a long rest.

| Witch Level | Maximum Challenge Rating |
|:--:|:--:|
| 6           | 1 |
| 12          | 2 |

### Level 10: Greater Borrowing

Your powers of borrowing grow stronger and shock even other witches.

You gain these benefits in addition to those of the _Borrowing_ feature:

#### Borrowed Instinct

While borrowing, you may add your Wisdom modifier to Perception and Stealth checks made through the borrowed creature, in addition to the creature&rsquo;s own modifiers.

#### Dangerous Creatures

You can take the **Attack** action while borrowing, using the creature&rsquo;s attack actions.

#### Extended Duration

If you borrow a creature for more than 8 hours, you gain 1 level of _Exhaustion_, and an additional level of exhaustion for each 8 hours thereafter.

#### Greater Form

Your borrowing is not limited to _Beast_ or _Plant_ creatures, and can borrow a creature with the **Swarm** trait (such as a _Swarm of Insects_). While borrowing a swarm, you perceive through all of its component creatures simultaneously, though you act as if you were a single creature.

#### Spellcasting

While borrowing, you can use the borrowed creature&rsquo;s reaction to cast a cantrip that has only verbal or somatic components. You must be able to provide any verbal or somatic components required in the borrowed creatures. You cannot concentrate on a spell cast this way. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Level 14: Malison

_I can't make you better, but I can make them worse._

You speak words or think thoughts that twist fate.

As a reaction when a creature you can see within 60 feet makes a **D20 Test**, you can grant **advantage** on that roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Evil Eye

Some magic is so bound up with witches that no one else dares touch it.
The cantip described here is always yours and doesn't count against the number of cantrips you know.

> _A glare that bites deeper than words._

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You fix your gaze on a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 psychic damage and be unable to take a reaction until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes no damage and suffers no additional effect.

This spell has no effect on targets that you cannot see or that cannot see you, such as yourself or targets blinded, invisible, or lacking visual senses. You must be within a target&rsquo;s line of sight; if you can see a target, you can discern whether it can see you. The force of your gaze when casting is sufficient to briefly turn their glance to you as you cast this spell.

### Cantrip Upgrade

You may target additional creatures when you reach levels 5 (up to 2 creatures), 11 (up to 3 creatures), and 17 (up to 4 creatures).
