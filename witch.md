### Witch Class Features

As a Witch, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Witch levels. These features are listed in the Witch Features table.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

Drawing from the land, necessity, and the teachings of other witches, you can cast spells.

**Cantrips.** You know three Witch cantrips of your choice.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Witch cantrip of your choice.

You learn an additional Witch cantrip at levels 4 and 10, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Witch Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Witch Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose **two** level 1 Witch spells.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Witch levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Witch Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Witch spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you&rsquo;re a level 3 Witch, your list of prepared spells can include four Witch spells of levels 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Witch feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Witch spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Witch level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Witch spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Witch spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an **arcane focus**, **herbalism kit**, or **cook&apos;s utensils** as a spellcasting focus for your Witch spells.

**TODO** Formatting is hard here. The full-page table messes with layout for other sections.

#### Level 1: Herbal Sage

Your understanding of plants and folk cures is guided by wisdom, not rote learning. You are wise in the ways of roots and remedies, leaves and mushrooms.

When using an _Herbalism Kit_, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Intelligence modifier for any ability checks made with the kit. You also add your proficiency bonus if you aren&rsquo;t already doing so.

In addition, you always have advantage on any ability check made using an _Herbalism Kit_.

#### Level 1: Witch Armor

You could avoid fate this time. A subtle curse sends ill luck to your foes, causing blows to falter and spells to misfire.

When a creature you can see makes an attack roll or casts a spell that targets only you, you can use your reaction to impose **disadvantage** on that roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Level 2: Sharp Words

You learn the *Hex* spell. It is always prepared for you and doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare.

You can cast *Hex* without expending a spell slot using only verbal components. You can do so twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Casting with spell slots follows the normal rules for spell components.

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Witch levels:
- **5th level**: 3 uses
- **11th level**: 4 uses
- **17th level**: 5 uses

When you cast *Hex* using this feature, you can use your Cook&rsquo;s Utensils or Herbalism Kit as your spellcasting focus.

#### Level 2: Dangerous Familiar

You learn the *Find Familiar* spell. It is always prepared for you and doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare. You can cast it once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

When casting *Find Familiar* using this feature, you do so as a ritual. You may use an Herbalism Kit or Cook&rsquo;s Utensils as your spellcasting focus for the casting.

**Independent Spirit.**
Your familiar is unusually willful and assertive. It can take the **Attack action** on its turn. When it does, it makes a single attack that benefits from your proficiency bonus. On turns it attacks, the familiar can&rsquo;t cast spells or deliver your spells.

{note}
**TODO:**
Consider subclass-specific upgrades to the familiar (e.g. form options, magical traits, casting abilities). <br>
At higher levels, allow familiars with higher CR, or enhanced functions akin to the Warlock's *Pact of the Chain*. <br>
Explore "Coven Familiars" or shared familiars as part of group or subclass features.
{note}

#### Level 3: Witch Subclass

You gain a Witch subclass of your choice.

#### Level 3: Second Sight

Your insight into others borders on the supernatural.

You gain proficiency in the _Insight_ skill. If you're already proficient in it, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it using your **expertise**.

### Level 5: Coven Magic

> _Three stand beneath the moon. The spell is cast not alone, but in echo and accord._

Starting at 5th level, your connection to your coven &mdash; real or imagined &mdash; grants you insight into deeper rituals.

You automatically learn **Augury**, and it counts as a Witch spell for you. You can cast it **as a ritual only**, even if you don&rsquo;t have it prepared.

In addition, choose one other ritual spell from any full caster&rsquo;s spell list (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard) of 3rd level or lower. This spell counts as a Witch spell for you, and you can cast it **as a ritual only**, even if you don&rsquo;t have it prepared.<br>

You may change this spell whenever you gain a level in this class, reflecting a shift in your coven&rsquo;s knowledge or priorities.

At higher levels, your coven&rsquo;s lore deepens:

| Witch Level | Ritual Spells Known | Max Spell Level |
|:-----------:|:-------------------:|:---------------:|
| 5           | 1                   | 3rd             |
| 9           | 2                   | 4th             |
| 13          | 3                   | 5th             |
| 17          | 4                   | 6th             |

You may only cast these spells as rituals. They do not count against your spells prepared.

When casting one of these rituals, you may use a **witch&rsquo;s focus** &mdash; an herbalism kit, cook&rsquo;s utensils, or arcane focus &mdash; in place of any material component that lacks a listed gold cost.
