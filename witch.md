# The Witch
A D&D 5e (2024) full-caster class. <br>
Not a Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, nor Wizard. Definitely not a martial. Someone to respect, listen to, and fear in confrontations.

The Witch is **High** in _complexity_ akin to Bard, Druid, Monk, Sorcerer, or Warlock.

##### Core Witch Traits
|||
|--|--|
| **Primary Ability** | Wisdom |
| **Hit Point Die** | D6 per Witch level |
| **Saving Throw Proficiencies** | Charisma and Wisdom |
| **Skill Proficiencies** | _Choose 2:_ Arcana, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Persuasion |
| **Weapon Proficiencies** | Simple weapons |
| **Tool Proficiencies** | Cook&rsquo;s Utensils, Herbalism Kit |
| **Armor Training** | None |
| **Starting Equipment** | Choose A or B: (A) Traveler's clothes (including a witch&rsquo;s hat); a component pouch or druidic focus; a sickle or quarterstaff; a _healer&rsquo;s kit_; an _herbalism kit_; _cook&rsquo;s utensils_; four candles; a pouch with 10 gp; and an explorer&rsquo;s pack; (B) 50 gp |

Witches rarely choose the path of magic so much as they are chosen by it. Signs of a witch&rsquo;s calling can appear early: an uncanny knack for spotting soon breaking storms, animals treating you as an old friend, or your stubborn refusal to be overawed regardless of station. You may have lived apart from others but still in the community — learning, watching, and earning respect (or fear). Your magic comes from knowing people and the world as it actually is, and intuition and willpower.

A Witch&rsquo;s powers sway crowds and kingdoms, glimpse the future, drive creatures of field, forest, and water, and protect those around them. There is whimsy and unreality in their actions and spells. A witch&rsquo;s curse is _terrible_.

Most Witches are not taught in academies but by fellow Witches or through unexpected callings. Many live apart from the world, as village healers, wandering seers, or craggy hermits. Others hold court as matriarchs, midwives, folk queens, or figures of local legend. Above all, a Witch seeks _respect_.

### Witch Class Features

As a Witch, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Witch levels. These features are listed in the Witch Features table.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells by drawing from people and the land, necessity and the teaching of other witches. See the D&amp;D _Player&rsquo;s Handbook_ for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Witch spell, which appear in the Witch spell list later in the class&rsquo;s description.

Every spell includes a brief note on how Witches tend to use it. These notes don't change the spell&rsquo;s mechanics but suggest tone and roleplay. A Witch often adds a personal flavor to a spell without changing the magic.

_**Cantrips.**_ You know three Witch cantrips of your choice. _Guidance_, _Thaumaturgy_, and _Toll the Dead_ are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Witch cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Witch levels 4, 10 and 16, you learn another Witch cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Witch Features table.

_**Spell Slots.**_ The Witch Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

_**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.**_ You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose three level 1 spells from the Witch spell list. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

</div>

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Witch levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Witch Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Witch spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you&rsquo;re a level 3 Witch, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Witch feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Witch spells for you.

_**Changing Your Prepared Spells.**_ Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells that you know.

_**Spellcasting Ability.**_
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Witch spells.

_**Spellcasting Focus.**_
You can use a Druidic Focus, _herbalism kit_, or _cook&rsquo;s utensils_ as a Spellcasting Focus for your Witch spells.

#### Level 1: Harsh Glare

Witches say the eyes speak before the mouth does. A curse carried in a glance, stopping hearts, thoughts, and hands.

You learn the **Harsh Glare** cantrip. It counts as a Witch cantrip for you and doesn't count against the number of cantrips you know. (The cantrip is described at the end.)

#### Level 1: Witch Armor

A new witch learns self-protection. A subtle curse sends ill luck to your foes, causing blows to falter and spells to misfire.

When a creature you can see makes an attack roll or casts a spell that targets only you, you can use your reaction to impose **disadvantage** on that roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 2: Cross Words

You learn the *Hex* spell. It is always prepared for you and doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare.

You can cast *Hex* without expending a spell slot using only verbal components. You can do so twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Casting with spell slots follows the normal rules for spell components.

You begin with 2 uses and gain additional uses when you reach certain Witch levels:
- **5th level**: 3 uses
- **11th level**: 4 uses
- **17th level**: 5 uses

#### Level 2: Second Sight

Your insight into others borders on the supernatural.

\page

You gain proficiency in the _Insight_ skill. If you are already proficient, you instead gain **expertise**, doubling your proficiency bonus on Insight checks. If you already have expertise in Insight, choose another Wisdom skill; you gain proficiency in it, or expertise if you are already proficient.

#### Level 2: Witch&rsquo;s Familiar

You learn the _Find Familiar_ spell. It is always prepared for you and doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare. You can cast it once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

| Witch Level | Maximum Familiar Challenge Rating (CR) |
|:--:|:--:|
| 2 | 0 |
| 9 | 1 |

_**Fearless**._ Your familiar gains immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions.

#### Level 3: Herbal Sage

Your understanding of animals, plants and folk cures is guided by wisdom, not rote learning. You are wise in the ways of roots and remedies.

You gain **expertise** with the _herbalism kit_ and double your proficiency bonus for any check using this tool.

#### Level 3: Witch Subclass

You gain a Witch subclass of your choice.

##### Choosing Your Calling

Every Witch walks their own path, and each Calling reflects not only choices in magic and powers, but also your talents and attitudes towards the world.

**The Maiden.** Curious, sharp-eyed, and strong of voice. If you enjoy uncovering truths, shaping social encounters, and carrying a versatile set of tricks, the Maiden suits you. This calling plays most like a Bard, with features that reward clever timing and sharp insight.

**The Mother.** Nurturing, protective, and steadfast. If you like bolstering allies, soothing wounds, and keeping the hearth warm even in the wild, the Mother will feel natural. This calling is closest to the Cleric, with more obvious but potent magic, support and healing.

**The Crone.** Mysterious, relentless, and rooted in deep lore. If you want to inhabit strange forms, command uncanny forces, and take on the risk of great power, the Crone is your path. This calling may be likened to a Moon Druid with a touch of Wizard, for players who relish mechanical depth.

{{note
**Player Tip.** If you’re new to the Witch, consider beginning with the **Mother** Calling. Its straightforward features will let you focus on learning the class before diving into the more intricate Maiden or Crone.
}}

#### Level 5: Coven Magic

> _Three stand beneath the moon. The spell is cast not alone, but in echo and accord._

Starting at 5th level, your connection to your coven &mdash; real or imagined &mdash; grants you insight into deeper rituals.

You automatically learn **Augury**, and it counts as a Witch spell for you. You can cast it **as a ritual only**, even if you don&rsquo;t have it prepared.

{note}
Bird flocks, tea leaves, lay of the cards &mdash;the auspices don't lie, they're only misread.
{note}

In addition, choose one other ritual spell from any full caster&rsquo;s spell list (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard) of 3rd level or lower. This spell counts as a Witch spell for you, and you can cast it **as a ritual only**, even if you don&rsquo;t have it prepared.

You may change this spell whenever you gain a level in this class, reflecting a shift in your coven&rsquo;s knowledge or priorities.

At higher levels, your coven&rsquo;s lore deepens:

| Witch Level | Ritual Spells Known | Max Spell Level |
|:-----------:|:-------------------:|:---------------:|
| 5           | 1                   | 3rd             |
| 9           | 2                   | 4th             |
| 13          | 3                   | 5th             |
| 17          | 4                   | 6th             |

You may only cast these spells as rituals. They do not count against your spells prepared.

When casting one of these rituals, may use your **spell focus** in place of any material component that lacks a listed gold cost.

#### Level 7: Token of Respect

{{note
Others know witches not just for their stare but for the magic they have and the items associated with them.
}}

When you gain this feature, choose one magic item that is Uncommon and requires attunement, or one that is Rare and does not require attunement. The item must be a Ring, Wand, or Wondrous Item and should suit your witchy theme. Your DM has final say on which items are available for this feature.

If the item requires attunement, it does not count against your maximum number of attuned items. You cannot transfer, sell, or destroy the item except by extraordinary means &mdash; it is specific to you. If the item is stolen, lost, or destroyed it becomes a non-magical mundane item for others, and you can use a 1 hour ritual to return it undamaged.

Items should evoke respect, mobility, protection, or nature&rsquo;s power such as _Bag of Beans_, _Broom of Flying_, _Cauldron of Plenty_, _Periapt of Wound Closure_, _Ring of Mind Shielding_, or _Wand of Entangle_. These examples represent different powers and aspects of witches.

\page

#### Level 9: Dangerous Familiar

Your familiar is stronger and unusually willful and assertive.

{{note
That Witch&rsquo;s creature gave me a wicked stare, and I knew it was not to be messed with.
}}

When you cast *Find Familiar*, you can choose any creature of Challenge Rating (CR) 1 or lower.

In combat, your familiar acts during your turn. A familiar can&rsquo;t attack, but it can move and take other actions. If you do one of the following your familiar may use the **Attack** action:

- Use a **Bonus Action** to mentally command it to take an action from its stat block.
- When you take the **Attack** action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to command the familiar to make one attack.

When your familiar makes an attack, it adds your proficiency bonus to its attack roll and damage roll. On turns it attacks, the familiar can&rsquo;t cast spells or deliver your spells.

#### Level 12: Witch&rsquo;s Insight

Your insight into fate and folly lets you tip the balance of events.

When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes a **D20 Test**, you can use your reaction to spend 1 use of this feature and impose **advantage** or **disadvantage** on that test. You must choose to do so **before** the roll is made.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your **proficiency bonus**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

##### 🔍 Utility, Ritual, &amp; Trickery

- **Arcane Eye** <br>
  You send forth an invisible scout &mdash; a wandering gaze that slips under doors and through darkness. It may look like a glimmering pupil, a raven&rsquo;s disembodied eye, or simply a floating mote that sees what you cannot. The Witch watches, even when she is not there.

- **Divination** <br>
  Smoke curling, bones rattling, or a hated mirror reflecting your true self.
  The future speaks if you open your senses.

  A Witch doesn't just recognize the words &mdash; she knows what that person meant.

_A steady hand soothes the worst hurts._

Whenever a creature of your choice (including you) rolls one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points at the end of a Short Rest, that creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.

In addition, once per long rest, you can tend to one creature during a Short Rest. That creature regains hit points by rolling one additional Hit Die without expending their current Hit Dice.

#### Level 10: Charm Offensive

_You wade into battle or soirees to lower tensions._

{{note
Some witches win fights by smiling, speaking softly, and watching the world rearrange around them. They had better respect you, and stop this nonsense.
}}

Your presence is a campaign in itself a deliberate act of charm and influence that can sway a crowd or halt a battle without violence.

You learn the _Aura of Calm_ spell. It counts as a Witch spell for you and doesn't count against the number of Witch spells you know. You can cast the spell without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. (The spell is described at the end.)

#### Level 10: Terrifying Familiar

_Your familiar draws respect and frightens others._

{{note
A familiar is more than a cute companion. Its claws, mismatched eyes, croaks or aggressive stance puts fear in the hearts of most. Some run away.
}}

When you command your familiar to take the **Attack** action using the rules of your _Dangerous Familiar_ feature, its attacks can unnerve its foes. Until the end of your next turn, whenever your familiar hits a creature with an attack, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Witch spell save DC or gain the **Frightened** condition until the end of its next turn.

Creatures immune to the **Frightened** condition are unaffected.

You can use this feature a number of times per long rest as shown in the _Terrifying Familiar Uses_ table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Level 3: Dark Intuition

Your magic knowledge or commanding presence borders on the supernatural.

You gain proficiency in your choice of the _Arcana_ or _Intimidation_ skill. If you are already proficient in the chosen skill, you gain **expertise** and double your proficiency bonus for any ability check using that skill.

#### Level 3: Crone Spells

When you choose this Calling at 3rd level, you gain additional spells that reflect the uncanny foresight and hard wisdom of a Witch in her full power. These spells are always prepared and count as Witch spells for you. They do not count against the number of spells you can prepare.

| Witch Level | Spells |
|:--:|:--|

| 5           | *Clairvoyance*, *Speak with Plants*, *Vampiric Touch* |
| 7           | *Blight*, *Death Ward* |
| 9           | *Compulsion*, *Dominate Beast*, *Phantasmal Killer* |

- **Beast Sense** <br>
  See though the eyes of a natural creature.
  One step from _Borrowing_ them.

- **Blight** <br>
  Destroy plant life or strongly damage a foe.
  Witches save their folk and are woe to those against.

\page

- **Counterspell** <br>
  A stern gesture and harsher word unravels enemy magic mid-cast.
  _Take that!_

- **Clairvoyance** <br>
  See or hear from afar through a chosen point.
  A bowl of water, a raven&rsquo;s eyes, a knot in the tree, all spy for you.

- **Command** <br>
  A single word for others to obey: sit, flee, drop, grovel.
  Respect of you is manifest.

- **Compulsion** <br>
  An irresistible pull—your voice bends the target&rsquo;s will, driving them to move in the path you choose.

- **Death Ward** <br>
  I had a quiet conversation with Death, and they must come twice for you this time.

- **Dominate Beast** <br>
  Strongly control a _beast_.
  You will pay the cost later, but right now your goals are all that matter.

- **Enthrall** <br>
  You catch their attention and hold it fast; a story, a look, or a song makes the world fall away for them.

- **Speak with Plants** <br>
  Whisper to leaves and roots; the green things of the world murmur back, gossiping about what they heard.

- **Phantasmal Force** <br>
  A hallucination so real it can hurt. Fear, shame, fire, or memory might be what the target conjures.

- **Phantasmal Killer** <br>
  You unearth the deepest terror in a creature&rsquo;s mind, and give it shape so it stalks them from within.

- **Vampiric Touch** <br>
  A draining grasp of necrotic hunger fueled by pain, healed by harm.

#### Level 6: Borrowing

_You inhabit the body of a natural creature for a time, controlling it as your own._

{{note
Some call this unnatural. Some call it supernatural. You know it is quite natural as long as you show respect.
}}

You can cast a special form of **Magic Jar** on a non-hostile _Beast_ or _Plant_ creature within range of your senses, and your body becomes motionless and unresponsive, appearing dead to casual observation. The target does not make a saving throw. Its own body serves as the container for the spell and remains aware as a silent, non-hostile observer.

The creature must lack the **Swarm** trait, cannot be sentient, and it must have an Intelligence score of 3 or lower. The target must have a Challenge Rating (CR) equal to or lower than your limit:

| Witch Level | Maximum Borrowing CR |
|:--:|:--:|
| 6  | 1/4 |
| 10 | 1 |
| 14 | 2 |

**Restrictions.** While in the borrowed form, you cannot use the **Attack** action or take a **Magic** action, except to end the effect and return to your body.

**Weariness.** Borrowing a creature is a mental and physical strain. While borrowing, you gain levels of *Exhaustion* as shown in the Weariness table. You also gain 1 additional level for each further period of that length you remain in the borrowed form.

| Witch Level | Hours to Exhaustion |
|:--:|:--:|
| 6  | 1 |
| 10 | 4 |
| 14 | 8 |

**Permanency.** If while borrowing you reach 6 levels of *Exhaustion* from any source, your own body dies, your separate mind is lost, and you permanently become that creature in all respects. Your new body immediately loses 1 level of *Exhaustion*.

**Returning.** When you return to your own body, voluntarily or otherwise, you fall **Prone** and are **Incapacitated** until the end of your next turn. The attitude of the borrowed creature towards you remains unchanged.

You can borrow a number of times equal to your **proficiency bonus**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Level 10: Greater Borrowing

_Your magic infuses the forms you inhabit, your will seeping through their voices and motions._

You can now borrow creatures with the **Swarm** trait.

While borrowing a creature, you can take the **Magic** action to cast Witch spells, with the following restrictions:

- You can only cast spells of **4th level or lower**.
- You cannot cast spells that require material components.
- You do not need a spellcasting focus while borrowing; the creature&rsquo;s body serves as your spellcasting focus, shaping its natural motions and sounds into the spell&rsquo;s expression.

**Limits to Power.** You still cannot take the **Attack** action while borrowing.

#### Level 14: Malison

_I can't make you better, but I can make them worse._

You speak words or think thoughts that twist fate.

As a reaction when a creature you can see within 60 feet makes a **D20 Test**, you can impose **disadvantage** on that roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

\page

# New Spells

The Witch has spells exclusive to them unless some Bard picks them up.

## Harsh Glare
_(Cantrip enchantment)_ {font-size:larger} <br>
_A glare that bites deeper than words._

{{note
Commonly known as the _Evil Eye_, this spell channels your will into a piercing glance to one or others.
}}

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You fix your gaze on a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 psychic damage and be unable to take a reaction until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes no damage and suffers no additional effect.

This spell has no effect on targets that you cannot see or that cannot see you, such as yourself or targets blinded, invisible, or lacking visual senses. You must be within a target&rsquo;s line of sight; if you can see a target, you can discern whether it can see you. The force of your gaze when casting is sufficient to briefly turn their glance to you as you cast this spell.

If you cast this spell, you can't take a _Magic Action_ on the same turn.

### Cantrip Upgrade

You may target additional creatures when you reach levels 5 (up to 2 creatures), 11 (up to 3 creatures), and 17 (up to 4 creatures).

## Aura of Calm
_(4th-level enchantment)_ {font-size:larger} <br>
_Your words and presence lower hostilities for now._

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This is a greater version of the _Calm Emotions_ spell.

You emanate an aura of supernatural charm by your words and presence that draws attention and softens hearts. Each creature of your choice that starts its turn within 20 feet of you, or enters the area for the first time on a turn, must make a Wisdom saving throw. Once the effect no longer applies to a creature &mdash; such as after a successful saving throw or the effect ending &mdash; it is immune for the rest of this casting of the spell.

On a failed save, choose one of the following effects for that creature:

- **Charm and Fear Suppression.** The creature has immunity to the _Charmed_ and _Frightened_ conditions until the spell ends. If the creature is already _Charmed_ or _Frightened_, those conditions are suppressed for the duration.
- **Attitude Shift.** The creature’s attitude toward you and creatures you choose shifts one step friendlier (_Hostile_ &rarr; _Indifferent_, _Indifferent_ &rarr; _Friendly_) for as long as the effect lasts. This change happens even if the creature is currently engaged in combat.
- **Word to the Wise.** For any Charisma check you make with the affected creatures you can substitute a Wisdom check if appropriate.

If an affected creature within your aura is attacked by you or your companions, the effect ends for all affected creatures in the aura, though the aura remains. When an affected creature leaves the aura, it immediately makes another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends for that creature.

When the effect ends for a creature (including when the spell ends), the improved attitude persists unless a significant event changes their mind, such as continuing combat with them or their allies (DM&rsquo;s discretion).

_The aura moves with you, remaining centered on you for the spell’s duration._
