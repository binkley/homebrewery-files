# The Witch
A D&D 5e (2024) spellcasting class. <br>

{note}

Witches are defined by their affinity with people and the world as it is. They read people, signs, and seasons; books are only a tool, not a devotion. Their magic arises from deep intuition and willpower, shaped by folk wisdom and occult traditions passed down through stories, dreams, and experience.

A Witch&rsquo's powers sway crowds and kingdoms, glimpse the future, drive creatures of field, forest, and water, and protect those around them. There is whimsy and unreality in their actions and spells. A witch&rsquo;s curse is _terrible_.

Most Witches are not taught in academies but by fellow Witches or through unexpected callings. Many live apart from the world, as village healers, wandering seers, or craggy hermits. Others hold court as matriarchs, midwives, folk queens, or figures of local legend. Above all, a Witch seeks _respect_.

### Witch Class Features

As a Witch, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Witch levels. These features are listed in the Witch Features table.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

Drawing from the land, necessity, and the teachings of other witches, you can cast spells.

**Cantrips.** You know three Witch cantrips of your choice.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Witch cantrip of your choice.

You learn an additional Witch cantrip at levels 4 and 10, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Witch Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Witch Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose **two** level 1 Witch spells.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Witch levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Witch Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Witch spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you&rsquo;re a level 3 Witch, your list of prepared spells can include four Witch spells of levels 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Witch feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Witch spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Witch level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Witch spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Witch spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an **druidic focus**, **herbalism kit**, or **cook&apos;s utensils** as a spellcasting focus for your Witch spells.

**TODO** Formatting is hard here. The full-page table messes with layout for other sections.

#### Level 1: Herbal Sage

Your understanding of plants and folk cures is guided by wisdom, not rote learning. You are wise in the ways of roots and remedies, leaves and mushrooms.

When using an _Herbalism Kit_, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Intelligence modifier for any ability checks made with the kit. You also add your proficiency bonus if you aren&rsquo;t already doing so.

In addition, you always have advantage on any ability check made using an _Herbalism Kit_.

#### Level 1: Witch Armor

You could avoid fate this time. A subtle curse sends ill luck to your foes, causing blows to falter and spells to misfire.

When a creature you can see makes an attack roll or casts a spell that targets only you, you can use your reaction to impose **disadvantage** on that roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Level 2: Cross Words

You learn the *Hex* spell. It is always prepared for you and doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare.

You can cast *Hex* without expending a spell slot using only verbal components. You can do so twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Casting with spell slots follows the normal rules for spell components.

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Witch levels:
- **5th level**: 3 uses
- **11th level**: 4 uses
- **17th level**: 5 uses

When you cast *Hex* using this feature, you can use your Cook&rsquo;s Utensils or Herbalism Kit as your spellcasting focus.

#### Level 2: Dangerous Familiar

You learn the *Find Familiar* spell. It is always prepared for you and doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare. You can cast it once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

When casting *Find Familiar* using this feature, you do so as a ritual. You may use an Herbalism Kit or Cook&rsquo;s Utensils as your spellcasting focus for the casting.

**Independent Spirit.**
Your familiar is unusually willful and assertive. It can take the **Attack action** on its turn. When it does, it makes a single attack that benefits from your proficiency bonus. On turns it attacks, the familiar can&rsquo;t cast spells or deliver your spells.

#### Level 3: Witch Subclass

You gain a Witch subclass of your choice.

#### Level 3: Second Sight

Your insight into others borders on the supernatural.

You gain proficiency in the _Insight_ skill. If you're already proficient in it, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it using your **expertise**.

### Level 5: Coven Magic

> _Three stand beneath the moon. The spell is cast not alone, but in echo and accord._

Starting at 5th level, your connection to your coven &mdash; real or imagined &mdash; grants you insight into deeper rituals.

You automatically learn **Augury**, and it counts as a Witch spell for you. You can cast it **as a ritual only**, even if you don&rsquo;t have it prepared.

In addition, choose one other ritual spell from any full caster&rsquo;s spell list (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard) of 3rd level or lower. This spell counts as a Witch spell for you, and you can cast it **as a ritual only**, even if you don&rsquo;t have it prepared.<br>

You may change this spell whenever you gain a level in this class, reflecting a shift in your coven&rsquo;s knowledge or priorities.

At higher levels, your coven&rsquo;s lore deepens:

| Witch Level | Ritual Spells Known | Max Spell Level |
|:-----------:|:-------------------:|:---------------:|
| 5           | 1                   | 3rd             |
| 9           | 2                   | 4th             |
| 13          | 3                   | 5th             |
| 17          | 4                   | 6th             |

You may only cast these spells as rituals. They do not count against your spells prepared.

When casting one of these rituals, you may use a **witch&rsquo;s focus** &mdash; an herbalism kit, cook&rsquo;s utensils, or druidic focus &mdash; in place of any material component that lacks a listed gold cost.

### Level 7: Witches Fly Free

You gain a **Broom of Flying**.

This is a powerful, storied magic item &mdash; some say too powerful. But when you need to be somewhere in a hurry, _flying_ is the only way to travel. It&rsquo;s amazing how much you can carry on a broom.

If you already possess this item, you are granted a different suitable magic item, chosen by the DM.

#### Difficult Customer

When haggling over other means of travel you have **advantage** on _Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion)_ checks_. Witches rarely pay full price for themselves, and never twice.

### Level 9: Improved Familiar

When casting **Find Familiar** you may choose any creature of challenge rating 1 or lower.

### Level 6: Borrowing

You inhabit the body of a natural creature for up to 1 day.

You can cast a special form of **Magic Jar** on a non-hostile _Beast_ or _Plant_ lacking the **Swarm** trait within range of your senses. The target does not make a saving throw. Its own body serves as the container for the spell, and remains aware as a silent, non-hostile observer.

At 10<sup>th</sup> level you may borrow a creature with the **Swarm** trait such as a _Swarm of Bats_.

If the creature is already possessed or protected by *Protection from Evil and Good*, *Magic Circle*, or similar magic, the borrowing fails. The target must have a challenge rating equal to or lower than your limit, as shown below.

Borrowing ends early if the borrowed creature drops to 0 hit points or after 1 day.

If the Witch borrows a creature for more than 1 hour, you gain 1 level of _Exhaustion_.

You may use this feature once, and regain its use when you finish a long rest.
