#### Level 1: Herbal Sage

Your understanding of plants and folk cures is guided by wisdom, not rote learning. You are wise in the ways of roots and remedies, leaves and mushrooms.

When using an _Herbalism Kit_, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Intelligence modifier for any ability checks made with the kit. You also add your proficiency bonus if you aren‚Äôt already doing so.

In addition, you always have advantage on any ability check made using an _Herbalism Kit_.

#### Level 1: Witch Armor

You could avoid fate this time. A subtle curse sends ill luck to your foes, causing blows to falter and spells to misfire.

When a creature you can see makes an attack roll or casts a spell that targets only you, you can use your reaction to impose **disadvantage** on that roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Level 2: Witch's Familiar

You learn the *Find Familiar* spell. It is always prepared for you and doesn‚Äôt count against the number of spells you can prepare. You can cast it once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

When casting *Find Familiar* using this feature, you do so as a ritual. You may use an Herbalism Kit or Cook‚Äôs Utensils as your spellcasting focus for the casting.

**Independent Spirit.**
Your familiar is unusually willful and assertive. It can take the **Attack action** on its turn. When it does, it makes a single attack that benefits from your proficiency bonus. On turns it attacks, the familiar can‚Äôt cast spells or deliver your spells.

{note}
**TODO:**
Consider subclass-specific upgrades to the familiar (e.g. form options, magical traits, casting abilities). <br>
At higher levels, allow familiars with higher CR, or enhanced functions akin to the Warlock's *Pact of the Chain*. <br>
Explore "Coven Familiars" or shared familiars as part of group or subclass features.
{note}

#### Level 3: Witch Subclass

You gain a Witch subclass of your choice.
