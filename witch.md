### Becoming a Witch ...

#### As a Level 1 Character

#### As a Multiclass Character

### Witch Class Features

As a Witch, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Witch levels. These features are listed in the Witch Features table.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

#### Level 1: Herbal Sage

Your understanding of plants and folk cures is guided by wisdom, not rote learning. You are wise in the ways of roots and remedies, leaves and mushrooms.

When using an _Herbalism Kit_, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Intelligence modifier for any ability checks made with the kit. You also add your proficiency bonus if you aren’t already doing so.

In addition, you always have advantage on any ability check made using an _Herbalism Kit_.

#### Level 1: Witch Armor

You could avoid fate this time. A subtle curse sends ill luck to your foes, causing blows to falter and spells to misfire.

When a creature you can see makes an attack roll or casts a spell that targets only you, you can use your reaction to impose **disadvantage** on that roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.


#### Level 3: Witch Subclass
