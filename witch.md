# The Witch

A D&D 5e (2024) full-caster class. <br>
Your Witch is a full caster rooted in willpower, wisdom, and presence. Not a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, nor Wizard&mdash;and certainly not martial. Respected and listened to, allies seek you, and enemies fear you.

Your Witch is **high** in complexity for player classes. You are distinct and can echo other casters in a witchy way without multiclassing.

##### Core Witch Traits

|||
|:-|:-|
| **Primary Ability** | Wisdom |
| **Hit Point Die** | D6 per Witch level |
| **Saving Throw Proficiencies** | Intelligence and Wisdom |
| **Skill Proficiencies** | _Choose 2:_ Arcana, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Persuasion |
| **Weapon Proficiencies** | Simple weapons |
| **Tool Proficiencies** | Cook&rsquo;s Utensils, Herbalism Kit |
| **Armor Training** | None |
| **Starting Equipment** | Choose A or B: (A) Traveler's clothes (including a witch&rsquo;s hat); a component pouch or druidic focus; a sickle or quarterstaff; a _healer&rsquo;s kit_; an _herbalism kit_; _cook&rsquo;s utensils_; ten candles; a pouch with 10 gp; and an explorer&rsquo;s pack; (B) 50 gp |

The Witch archetype is persistent across all cultures. Named examples include _Tasha_, the _Discworld_ witches, _Baba Yaga_, _Louhi_, _Chedipe_, _Yama-uga_, _Shuima_, _La Lechuza_, _Medea_, and others. They live in boundaries and edges: life and death, success and failure, fear and love. They live "in the now" while also seeing past and future. They are more interested in what is real than what might have been.

Rarely do witches choose this path so much as they are born innately to it. Signs of a Witch&rsquo;s calling can appear early: an uncanny knack for spotting soon breaking storms, animals treating you as an old friend, or your stubborn refusal to be overawed regardless of station. You may have lived apart from others but still in the community — learning, watching, and earning respect (or fear). Your magic comes from knowing people and the world as it actually is, and intuition and willpower.

A Witch&rsquo;s powers sway crowds and kingdoms, glimpse the future, drive creatures of field, forest, and water, and protect those around them. There is whimsy and unreality in their actions and spells. A Witch&rsquo;s curse is _terrible_.

Most Witches are not taught in academies but by fellow Witches or through unexpected callings. Many live apart from the world, as village healers, wandering seers, or craggy hermits. Others hold court as matriarchs, midwives, folk queens, or figures of local legend. Above all, a Witch seeks _respect_.

### Becoming a Witch ...

The Witch class holds several themes together:

- **Balance** &mdash; good, bad, or neutral as you pick
- **Boundaries** &mdash; draw a line to cross or stay within
- **Colors** &mdash; you know there are more than 7 colors
- **Conditions** &mdash; you make them better or worse
- **Curses** &mdash; not just your promises but warnings
- **Cycles** &mdash; you alter the Almanac and moonlight
- **Fate** &mdash; twist and turn outcomes
- **Mind** &mdash; it's all in their head until you make it so
- **Nature** &mdash; bring storms or borrow creatures
- **Respect** &mdash; others should respect or fear you
- **Thoughts** &mdash; who else would notice and reflect?
- **Travel** &mdash; a broom is the best way to fly
- **Voice** &mdash; power from words not a pointy stick

#### As a Level 1 Character

- Gain all the tratis in the Core Witch Traits table.
- Gain the Witch&rsquo;s level 1 features, which are listed in the Witch Features table.

#### As a Multiclass Character

- Gain the following traits from the Core Witch Traits table: Hit Point Die, proficiency in one skill of your choice, and proficiency with the _herbalism kit_.
- Gain the Witch&rsquo;s level 1 features, which are listed in the Witch Features table. See the multiclassing rules in the D&D _Player&rsquo;s Handbook_ to determine your available spell slots.

### Witch Class Features

As a Witch, you gain the following class features when you reach the specified Witch levels. These features are listed in the Witch Features table.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells by drawing from people and the land, necessity and the teaching of other witches. See the D&D _Player&rsquo;s Handbook_ for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Witch spell, which appear in the Witch spell list later in the class&rsquo;s description.

Every spell includes a brief note on how Witches tend to use it. These notes don't change the spell&rsquo;s mechanics but suggest tone and roleplay. A Witch often adds a personal flavor to a spell without changing the magic.

}}

_**Cantrips.**_ You know three Witch cantrips of your choice. _[Guidance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Guidance)_, _[Thaumaturgy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Thaumaturgy)_, and _Toll the Dead_ are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Witch cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Witch levels 4, 10 and 16, you learn another Witch cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Witch Features table.

_**Spell Slots.**_ The Witch Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

_**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.**_ You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose three level 1 spells from the Witch spell list. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Witch levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Witch Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Witch spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you&rsquo;re a level 3 Witch, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Witch feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Witch spells for you.

_**Changing Your Prepared Spells.**_ Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Witch spells from the Witch spell list of levels for which you have spell slots.

_**Spellcasting Ability.**_
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Witch spells.

_**Spellcasting Focus.**_
You can use a [druidic focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#DruidicFocusVaries), _herbalism kit_, or _cook&rsquo;s utensils_ as a [spellcasting focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#SpellcastingFocus) for your Witch spells.

#### Level 1: Harsh Glare

_Witches say the eyes speak before the mouth does._

You learn the _Harsh Glare_ cantrip. It counts as a Witch cantrip for you and doesn't count against the number of cantrips you know. (The cantrip is described at the end.)

#### Level 1: Home Territory

_Now that's a lovely new garden. I wonder what they're growing in it? Let's go find out._

Every Witch has a place they call their own: a valley, village, forest, coast, sea, or patch of moorland. It may be no more than a day&rsquo;s walk across, but you belong to it and it belongs to you.

_**Homebody.**_ While in your home territory, [difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain) does not slow you or your group.

\page

_**There&rsquo;s No Place Like Home.**_ When you make _Intelligence ([History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/playing-the-game#Skills))_, _Intelligence ([Nature](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/playing-the-game#Skills))_, or _Wisdom ([Survival](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/playing-the-game#Skills))_ checks related to your home territory, you can replace the d20 roll with a 20. You can use this feature two times, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

The DM and player should decide together what constitutes your home territory when becoming a Witch suitable to your background and backstory. Over a lifetime, a Witch may find more than one place to call home. Each time you live and work in a new area for a year or more, your DM may let you claim that new area as an additional home territory for this feature.

#### Level 1: Witch Armor

_A new witch learns self-protection._

When a creature you can see makes an attack roll or casts a spell that targets only you, you can use your reaction to impose [disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on that roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your _proficiency bonus_. You regain all expended uses when you finish a [long rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 2: Cross Words

You learn the [Hex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Hex) spell. It is always prepared for you and doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare. When you cast _Hex_, the extra damage it deals is **psychic** instead of **necrotic**.

You can cast _Hex_ without expending a spell slot, using only verbal components. When you do so, you use one of your Cross Words uses. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Casting with spell slots follows the normal rules for spell components.

You begin with 1 use, and the number of uses increases as you gain Witch levels, as shown in the Cross Words Uses column of the Witch Features table.

#### Level 2: Second Thoughts

_Your insight into others borders on the supernatural._

You gain proficiency in the _Wisdom ([Insight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/playing-the-game#Skills))_ skill. If you are already proficient, you instead gain **expertise**, doubling your proficiency bonus on Insight checks. If you already have expertise in Insight, choose another Wisdom skill; you gain proficiency in it, or expertise if you are already proficient.

#### Level 2: Witch&rsquo;s Familiar

You learn the [Find Familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#FindFamiliar) spell. It is always prepared for you and doesn&rsquo;t count against the number of spells you can prepare. You can cast it once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

| Witch Level | Maximum Familiar Challenge Rating (CR) |
|:--:|:--:|
| 2 | 0 |
| 9 | 1/2 |

_**Fearless**._ Your familiar gains immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions.

#### Level 3: Herbal Sage

Your understanding of animals, plants and folk cures is guided by wisdom, not rote learning. You are wise in the ways of roots and remedies.

You gain **expertise** with the _herbalism kit_ and double your proficiency bonus for any check using this tool. Additionally, when you use your herbalism kit to brew a _Potion of Healing_, the time and cost required are halved for you.

#### Level 3: Witch Subclass

You gain a Witch subclass of your choice.

##### Choosing Your Calling

Every Witch walks their own path, and each Calling reflects your talents and attitudes towards the world in features and magic.

**The Maiden.** Curious, strong-eyed, strong of voice, and thoughtful. If you enjoy uncovering truths, shaping social encounters, and a versatile set of tricks, the Maiden may suit you. This calling plays most similiar to a Bard, with features that reward clever timing and sharp insight.

**The Mother.** Nurturing, protective, and steadfast. If you like bolstering allies, soothing wounds, and keeping the hearth warm even in the wild, the Mother will feel natural. This calling is closest to the Cleric, with more obvious but potent magic, support and healing.

**The Crone.** Mysterious, relentless, and rooted in deep lore. If you want to inhabit strange forms, command uncanny forces, and take on the risk of great power, the Crone is your path. This calling may be likened to a Moon Druid with a touch of Wizard, for players who relish mechanical depth.

#### Level 5: Coven Magic

_Three stand beneath the moon. The spell is cast not alone, but in accord. Birds flock, tea leaves, cards lay. The auspices don't lie, they're only misread._

Your bond with a coven&mdash;real or not&mdash;grants you insight into deeper rituals.

- You learn the [Augury](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Augury) spell. It is always prepared, counts as a Witch spell for you, and can only be cast this way as a ritual.
- In addition, you learn one ritual spell of 3rd level or lower from any class&rsquo;s spell list, as approved by your DM. It is always prepared, counts as a Witch spell for you, and can only be cast this way as a ritual. Each time you gain a Witch level, you may replace any ritual spell learned from this feature (not including _Augury_) with another ritual spell, subject to the maximum level you can know.

These spells do not count against the number of spells you can prepare.

At higher levels, your coven&rsquo;s lore deepens and you can learn additional ritual spells:

\page

| Witch Level | Additional Spells  | Max Spell Level |
|:-----------:|:------------------:|:---------------:|
| 5 | 1 | 3 |
| 9 | 2 | 4 |
| 13 | 3 | 5 |
| 17 | 4 | 6 |

#### Level 7: Token of Respect

_Some recognize witches for their stare, some for the magic they bear._

When you gain this feature, choose one magic item that is Uncommon and requires attunement, or one that is Rare and does not require attunement. The item must be a Ring, Wand, or Wondrous Item and should suit your witchy theme. Your DM has final say on which items are available for this feature.

You cannot transfer, sell, or destroy the item except by extraordinary means&mdash;it is specific to you. If the item is stolen, lost, or destroyed it becomes a non-magical mundane item for others, and you can use a 1 hour ritual to return it undamaged.

Items should evoke respect, mobility, protection, or nature&rsquo;s power such as _Bag of Beans_, _Broom of Flying_, _Cauldron of Plenty_, _Periapt of Wound Closure_, _Ring of Mind Shielding_, or _Wand of Entangle_. These examples represent different powers and aspects of witches.

#### Level 9: Dangerous Familiar

_Your familiar is stronger and unusually willful._

When you cast _Find Familiar_, you can choose a creature of Challenge Rating (CR) 1/2 or lower for its form.

When you take the **Attack** action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its Reaction.

When your familiar makes an attack, it adds your proficiency bonus to the attack roll and the damage roll, and can&rsquo;t cast or deliver spells.

#### Level 11: Cauldron Magic

You learn the _Tasha&rsquo;s Bubbling Cauldron_ spell. It is always prepared, counts as a Witch spell for you, and can only be cast this way as a ritual even though it does not normally have the Ritual tag.

#### Level 12: Pointing Curse

At 12th level, your curses leave an indelible mark on victims. When a creature is under the effect of your _Hex_ spell cast with the **Cross Words** feature, you have a constant sense of their general direction and distance from you, as long as are both on the same plane of existence. This appears as an invisible pointing hand that only you can perceive.

Additionally, that creature doesn&rsquo;t benefit from half or three-quarters cover against any spell you cast that targets only it, and it has disadvantage on saving throws against scrying or location spells that you cast against it while the hex lasts.

#### Level 17: Final Words

When you use **Cross Words** to cast _Hex_ without expending a spell slot, you can choose to empower it with Final Words.

While empowered in this way, until the spell ends, whenever you or an **ally within 30 feet of you** deals damage to the cursed target with an attack roll, the target also takes the extra psychic damage from your _Hex_.

This damage is applied only once per attack, regardless of the number of hits or damage dice rolled.

You can empower your _Hex_ with Final Words twice, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Level 18: Witch&rsquo;s Insight

Your insight into fate and folly lets you tip the balance of events.

When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes a **D20 Test**, you can you can use your reaction after the creature rolls but before the outcome is determined to impose **advantage** or **disadvantage** on that test.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your **proficiency bonus**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Level 20: Indomitable Will

_A Witch masters their own mind, bows to no king, fears no shadow, and bends to no enchantments._

Your wisdom and presence have reached their fullest strength.

- Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 23.
- You are immune to the **Charmed** and **Frightened** conditions.
- You have **advantage on all saving throws** against Enchantment spells and effects. On a successful save, you ignore the effect entirely, as if it never touched your mind.

## Witch Spell List

Not just a plain list, but some description how to use, and why a Witch knows these.

{{note
##### Spells from Outside the PHB (2024)
Most Witch spells are listed in the Basic Rules (2024 with links to SRD) or in the _Player&rsquo;s Handbook_ (2024).
A few come from other published WotC sources. DMs should decide which non-core sourcebooks to use including: _Elemental Evil Player&rsquo;s Companion_, _Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos_, _Tasha&rsquo;s Cauldron of Everything_, _The Book of Many Things_, and _Xanathar&rsquo;s Guide to Everything_. Spells are noted when sourced in these books.

You gain a Witch subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Witch levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass&rsquo;s features that are of your Witch level or lower.

### The Maiden Calling

_Weave Light, Song and Hidden Truths_

The Maiden Calling represents renewal and charm, a figure of brightness who bends hearts and perception with equal ease. She is youth&rsquo;s courage, whimsy, and allure, standing at the threshold between innocence and cunning. The Maiden&rsquo;s power turns foes against themselves, shields companions, and cloaks truth in illusions that delight or confound.

Playing a Maiden Witch means embracing versatility and performance. You may weave illusions, manipulate emotions, or shield companions with spells that feel as much like dance as war. Your role is often to influence the field without brute force, creating openings for others. The Maiden thrives in players who enjoy creativity and social subtlety as much as combat tactics.

#### Level 3: Inner Discovery

Your herbal knowledge or your voice borders on the supernatural.

You gain proficiency in your choice of the _Nature_ or _Performance_ skill. If you are already proficient in the chosen skill, you gain **expertise** and double your proficiency bonus for any ability check you make using that skill.

#### Level 3: Maiden Spells

When you choose this Calling at 3rd level, you gain additional spells that reflect the wild, bright magic of youthful witches. These spells are always prepared and count as Witch spells for you. They do not count against the number of spells you can prepare.

  A silver glow like moonlight clings to your allies, warding them from poison, disease, and foul influence.

  Flair, chaos, and a touch of drama can be as potent as blades.

  Enchant the air around foes to make obvious targets and reveal the unseen.

  You or another you touch _stay_ invisible.
  Perfect daggers or kisses slipped unseen.

\page

- **[Hallucinatory Terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#HallucinatoryTerrain)** <br>
  A forest, a graveyard glade, a marsh a sunlit shore, up to your imagination.
  You rewrite the world for targets.

- **[Major Image](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#MajorImage)** <br>
  Craft full illusions that speak, move, and mislead.
  Convince the senses and the soul may follow.

- **[Moonbeam](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Moonbeam)** <br>
  A radiant pillar of lunar light burns away foes and blocks their egress.
  Why can&rsquo;t I cast this at coven?

#### Level 6: Third Thoughts

_You hear the voice beneath the voice, and your own words do more than expected._

You gain these benefits:

_**Eye for Reality.**_ You gain **advantage** on _Wisdom (Insight and Perception)_ checks.

_**Spotting Trouble.**_ As a reaction, when a creature within 30 feet makes a _Charisma (Deception)_ or _Dexterity (Stealth)_ check, you can impose **disadvantage** on the roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

_**Strong Voice.**_ When you cast a spell, you can ignore its somatic component and any material component that lacks a listed gold cost. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 10: Vine, Vision and Voice

_You are never just one thing. Your strength lies contradiction, and people hear you out._

As a bonus action, you can call upon one of three auras of presence, which extend 10 feet from you in all directions. The aura moves with you, lasts for 1 minute, and requires your concentration.

- **Entangling Aura.** When a creature enters the aura for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your Witch spell save DC or its speed is halved until the start of its next turn.

- **Revealing Aura.** Creatures affected by the aura cannot benefit from the _Invisible_ condition and have disadvantage on _Charisma (Deception)_ checks.

- **Commanding Aura.** Creatures affected by the aura have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

You can activate one of these auras a number of times per long rest as shown in the _Aura Uses_ table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

| Witch Level | Aura Uses |
|:--:|:--:|
| 10 | 2 |
| 17 | 3 |

#### Level 14: Singsong

_Your voice weaves a binding harmony that steadies hearts and wards off hostile magic._

As an action, you begin a mystical singsong that lasts for 1 minute, requiring concentration as though you were concentrating on a spell. While it lasts, each ally of your choice within 30 feet of you has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

### The Mother Calling

_Guard Hearth, Heal Hurts and Bind Oaths_

The Mother Calling embodies protection, resilience, and the binding power of oaths. She heals with one hand and curses with the other, knowing that true guardianship sometimes demands sternness. In her presence, communities stand stronger, and her allies find courage drawn from her steady will.

Playing a Mother Witch often means balancing nurture with discipline. You may restore vitality, shield allies from harm, or place geas and bindings on those who break their word. Your magic creates trust, but also obligation&mdash;making you a figure both of comfort and authority. The Mother thrives in players who enjoy being the moral compass or anchor of their party.

#### Level 3: Trusted Wisdom

_Your people or hearth skills are exceptional._

{{note
Would you like another cup of tea, dear? I have a poultice for that and I won't tell a word.
}}

You gain proficiency in your choice of the _Medicine_ or _Persuasion_ skill. If you are already proficient in the chosen skill, you gain **expertise** and double your proficiency bonus for any ability check using that skill.

#### Level 3: Mother Spells

When you choose this Calling at 3rd level, you gain additional spells that reflect the nurturing, protective, sensible magic of matron witches. These spells are always prepared and count as Witch spells for you. They do not count against the number of spells you can prepare.

| Witch Level | Spell |
|:--:|:--|
| 3 | *Aid*, *Ceremony*, *Comprehend Languages*, *Haste*, *Slow* |
| 5 | *Create Food and Water*, *Leomund&rsquo;s Tiny Hut*, *Life Transference*, *Tongues* |

- **[Comprehend Languages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#ComprehendLanguages)** <br>
  You understand the meaning of spoken and written words, though your replies may be more creative than correct.
  A Witch doesn't just recognize the words&mdash;she knows what that person meant.

- **[Create Food and Water](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#CreateFoodandWater)** <br>
  No one goes without when a proper witch in their company.

- **[Greater Restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#GreaterRestoration)** <br>
  Fixes most serious ailments and cursed magic items.
  _Now doesn't that feel better?_

- **[Leomund&rsquo;s Tiny Hut](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#LeomundsTinyHut)** <br>
  A safe space from magic and the natural elements.
  It&rsquo;s not much, but better than nothing and a fireball.

- **Life Transference** <br>
  Give your some of your life force to heal another.
  _This hurts; it really hurts. It hurts me more than it does you._

#### Level 6: Balm of Willow-weed

_A steady hand soothes the worst hurts._

Whenever a creature of your choice (including you) rolls one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points at the end of a Short Rest, that creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.

In addition, once per long rest, you can tend to one creature during a Short Rest. That creature regains hit points by rolling one additional Hit Die without expending their current Hit Dice.

When you craft a _Potion of Healing_ it produces instead a _Greater Potion of Healing_.

#### Level 10: Charm Offensive

_You wade into battle or soirees to lower tensions._

Your presence is a campaign in itself a deliberate act of charm and influence that can sway a crowd or halt a battle without violence.

You learn the _Aura of Calm_ spell. It counts as a Witch spell for you and doesn't count against the number of Witch spells you know. You can cast the spell a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. (The spell is described at the end.)

#### Level 10: Terrifying Familiar

_Your familiar draws respect and frightens others._

When you command your familiar to take the **Attack** action using the rules of your _Dangerous Familiar_ feature, its attacks can unnerve its foes. Until the end of your next turn, whenever your familiar hits a creature with an attack, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your Witch spell save DC or gain the **Frightened** condition until the end of its next turn.

Creatures immune to the **Frightened** condition are unaffected.

You can use this feature a number of times per long rest as shown in the _Terrifying Familiar Uses_ table. You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

| Witch Level | Terrifying Familiar Uses |
|:--:|:--:|
| 10 | 2 |
| 17 | 3 |

#### Level 14: Benison

_I can't make them worse, but I can make you better._

You speak words or think thoughts that twist fate.

As a reaction when a creature you can see within 60 feet makes a **D20 Test**, you can grant **advantage** on that roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### The Crone Calling

_Turn Fear, Beasts and Minds into Power_

The Crone Calling is wisdom sharpened into dread. She speaks with spirits, curses the arrogant, and sees paths others fear to tread. Even other witches keep their distance, for her Borrowing and baleful gaze unsettle all. The Crone is not cruelty for its own sake, but she ensures that fear teaches where gentler lessons fail.

Playing a Crone Witch often means carrying the weight of difficult choices. You may be asked to risk your body and mind in Borrowing, to step beyond the mortal frame for answers others cannot reach. You wield magic that unnerves allies as much as enemies, and your power makes you a figure of awe or suspicion. The Crone thrives when played with care for her limits as well as her strengths.

#### Level 3: Dark Intuition

Your magic knowledge or commanding presence borders on the supernatural.

You gain proficiency in your choice of the _Arcana_ or _Intimidation_ skill. If you are already proficient in the chosen skill, you gain **expertise** and double your proficiency bonus for any ability check you make using that skill.

\page

#### Level 3: Crone Spells

When you choose this Calling at 3rd level, you gain additional spells that reflect the uncanny foresight and hard wisdom of a Witch in her full power. These spells are always prepared and count as Witch spells for you. They do not count against the number of spells you can prepare.

| Witch Level | Spells |
|:--:|:--|
| 3 | *Beast Sense*, *Command*, *Counterspell*, *Enthrall*, *Phantasmal Force* |
| 5 | *Clairvoyance*, *Speak with Plants*, *Vampiric Touch* |
| 7 | *Blight*, *Death Ward* |
| 9 | *Compulsion*, *Dominate Beast*, *Phantasmal Killer* |

- **Beast Sense** <br>
  See though the eyes of a natural creature.
  One step from _Borrowing_ them.

- **[Clairvoyance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Clairvoyance)** <br>
  See or hear from afar through a chosen point.
  A bowl of water, a raven&rsquo;s eyes, a knot in the tree, all spy for you.

- **[Compulsion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Compulsion)** <br>
  An irresistible pull&mdash;your voice bends the target&rsquo;s will, driving them to move in the path you choose.

- **[Death Ward](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#DeathWard)** <br>
  I had a quiet conversation with Death, and they must come twice for you this time.

- **[Dominate Beast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#DominateBeast)** <br>
  Strongly control a _beast_.
  You will pay the cost later, but right now your goals are all that matter.

- **[Enthrall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Enthrall)** <br>
  Your catch attention and hold it fast when no one's fighting.

- **[Phantasmal Force](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#PhantasmalForce)** <br>
  A hallucination so real it can hurt. Fear, shame, fire, or memory might be what the target conjures.

- **[Phantasmal Killer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#PhantasmalKiller)** <br>
  You unearth the deepest terror in a creature&rsquo;s mind, and give it shape so it stalks them from within.

- **[Speak with Plants](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#SpeakwithPlants)** <br>
  Whisper to leaves and roots; the green things of the world murmur back, gossiping about what they heard.

- **[Vampiric Touch](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#VampiricTouch)** <br>
  A draining grasp of necrotic hunger fueled by pain, healed by harm.

#### Level 6: Borrowing

_You inhabit the body of a natural creature for a time, controlling it as your own._

{{note
Some call this unnatural. Some call it supernatural. You know it is quite natural as long as you show respect.
}}

You can cast a special form of **Magic Jar** on a non-hostile _Beast_ or _Plant_ creature within range of your senses, and your body becomes motionless and unresponsive, appearing dead to casual observation. The target does not make a saving throw. Its own body serves as the container for the spell and remains aware as a silent, non-hostile observer.

The creature must lack the **Swarm** trait, cannot be sentient, and it must have an Intelligence score of 3 or lower. The target must have a Challenge Rating (CR) equal to or lower than your limit:

| Witch Level | Maximum Borrowing CR |
|:--:|:--:|
| 6  | 1/4 |
| 10 | 1 |
| 14 | 2 |

{{note
**DM Guidance&mdash;Borrowing Targets.** Outside truly barren locales (airless void, deep astral, featureless demiplane), assume either no or one or more eligible Beasts or Plants nearby by narrative convenience. Favor creatures that fit the situation and CR limits; the witch chooses among the options you present.
}}

_**Availability.**_ In all but the most barren environments, suitable Beast or Plant creatures are typically present for you to borrow (DM&rsquo;s discretion). When multiple options exist, you choose the creature. Such forms may be inconvenient or unsuitable to your plans; you can decline to borrow without expending a use of this feature.

_**Limits to Power.**_ While in the borrowed form, you cannot use the **Attack** action or take a **Magic** action, except to end the effect and return to your body.

_**Weariness.**_ Borrowing a creature is a mental and physical strain. While borrowing, you gain levels of *Exhaustion* as shown in the Weariness table. You also gain 1 additional level for each further period of that length you remain in the borrowed form.

| Witch Level | Hours to Exhaustion |
|:--:|:--:|
| 6  | 1 |
| 10 | 4 |
| 14 | 8 |

_**Permanency.**_ If while borrowing you reach 6 levels of *Exhaustion* from any source, your own body dies, your separate mind is lost, and you permanently become that creature in all respects. Your new body immediately loses 1 level of *Exhaustion*.

_**Returning.**_ When you return to your own body, voluntarily or otherwise, you fall **Prone** and are **Incapacitated** until the end of your next turn. The attitude of the borrowed creature towards you remains unchanged.

You can borrow a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

\page

#### Level 10: Greater Borrowing

_Your magic infuses the forms you inhabit, your will seeping through their voices and motions._

You can now borrow creatures with the **Swarm** trait.

While borrowing a creature, you can take the **Magic** action to cast Witch spells, with the following restrictions:

- You can only cast spells of **4th level or lower**.
- You cannot cast spells that require material components.
- You do not need a spellcasting focus while borrowing; the creature&rsquo;s body serves as your spellcasting focus, shaping its natural motions and sounds into the spell&rsquo;s expression.

_**Limits to Power.**_ You still cannot take the **Attack** action while borrowing.

#### Level 14: Malison

_I can't make you better, but I can make them worse._

You speak words or think thoughts that twist fate.

As a reaction when a creature you can see within 60 feet makes a **D20 Test**, you can impose **disadvantage** on that roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

# New Spells

### Harsh Glare
_(Cantrip enchantment)_ {font-size:larger} <br>
_A glare that bites deeper than words._

{{note
Commonly known as the _Evil Eye_, this spell channels your will into a piercing glance to one or others.
}}

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You fix your gaze on a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 psychic damage and be unable to take a reaction until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes no damage and suffers no additional effect.

This spell has no effect on targets you can't see or that can't see you.  The force of your gaze when casting is sufficient to briefly turn their glance to you as you cast this spell.

#### Cantrip Upgrade

You may target additional creatures when you reach levels 5 (up to 2 creatures), 11 (up to 3 creatures), and 17 (up to 4 creatures).

### Aura of Calm
_(4th-level enchantment)_ {font-size:larger} <br>
_Your words and presence lower hostilities for now._

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This is a greater version of the _Calm Emotions_ spell.

You emanate an aura of supernatural charm by your words and presence that draws attention and softens hearts. Each creature of your choice that starts its turn within 20 feet of you, or enters the area for the first time on a turn, must make a Wisdom saving throw. Once the effect no longer applies to a creature&mdash;such as after a successful saving throw or the effect ending&mdash;it is immune for the rest of this casting of the spell.

On a failed save, choose one of the following effects for that creature:

- **Charm and Fear Suppression.** The creature has immunity to the _Charmed_ and _Frightened_ conditions until the spell ends. If the creature is already _Charmed_ or _Frightened_, those conditions are suppressed for the duration.
- **Attitude Shift.** The creature&rsquo;s attitude toward you and creatures you choose shifts one step friendlier (_Hostile_ &rarr; _Indifferent_, _Indifferent_ &rarr; _Friendly_) for as long as the effect lasts. This change happens even if the creature is currently engaged in combat.
- **Word to the Wise.** For any Charisma check you make with the affected creatures you can substitute a Wisdom check if appropriate.
 
If an affected creature within your aura is attacked by you or your companions, the effect ends for all affected creatures in the aura, though the aura remains. When an affected creature leaves the aura, it immediately makes another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends for that creature.

When the effect ends for a creature (including when the spell ends), the improved attitude persists unless a significant event changes their mind, such as continuing combat with them or their allies (DM&rsquo;s discretion).

_The aura moves with you, remaining centered on you for the spell&rsquo;s duration._
