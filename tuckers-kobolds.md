# Tucker&rsquo;s Kobolds

A one-shot dungeon for higher-level characters based on the famous _Tucker&rsquo;s Kobolds_ from [_Dragon 127_](https://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/TuckersKobolds.pdf). This was used as a popular tournament dungeon, and here updated for D&amp;D 5e.

<br/>

{note}
The party prepares for a "big boss" encounter only to find _death by 1,000 cuts_ from Kobolds.
Your goal is to make adventuring miserable for a party of high-level characters, and negate their "super" powers.
{note}

### DM Goals

**Your goal**: _Kill the characters though your monsters are vastly outmatched_.

In direct 1-on-1 combat a character should always win. But you don&rsquo;t plan to lose. Make heavy use of traps, mob tactics, mobility, and positioning and control to see the field yielded to your monsters against a powerful party.

Make the party retreat while screaming: _Oh no, here come the Kobolds again!_

### DM Strategy

Monsters employ cunning and rely heavily on traps. They are skirmishers and avoid direct combat. Example tactics include:

- Traps or tactics that split the character party.
- Lean into character checks that are weak at higher-levels.
- "Hide and seek" tactics of firing ranged weapons from tunnels or murder holes, and denying a clear target for characters to attack.
- Summoning other suitable monsters to waste character time while the Kobolds regroup.
- Reliance on fire or poison for trap or weapon damange with frequent DC checks until some fail.

Players will spend turns to use _Perception_ or _Investigation_ checks, or cast the unhelpful [Find Traps](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#FindTraps) spell. Pepper them with ranged damage from inaccessible murder holes to encourage progress.

### Hook the Characters

A prominent local NPC provides an excuse for the party to defeat a "big boss" in a cave system (possibly nearby), and to recover "the item" (a MacGuffin). Explain that the locals need help from your great (high-level) party, and suggest a reward suitably enticing for the party level.

The NPC mentions in pasing that there may be weak creatures in the caves&mdash;no challenge for a party of this callibre&mdash;on the way to accomplish their goal. Play down the challenge of these "trash mobs" on the way to the goal.

### Powerful Characters

Players should create or use higher-level but not end-game characters: levels 10-13 is good level range. Use the opening hook to encourage single-target attacks, nova damage, strong spell casters, so on.

### Travel

Everything is a tunnel and the denizens made passage challenging. Treat travel as [Difficult Terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain). Each tunnel turns away after 20 feet or less making visiblity its own challenge.

Characters see narrow additional passages. _Medium_ [size](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Size) characters cannot fit in these though _Small_ or _Tiny_ creatures can but at their peril. In addition, there are frequent openings and gaps which no character may fit into but would accomodate ranged attack.

### Example Traps

Traps are throughout the dungeon. A typical trap can be spotted with a DC 15 _Investigation_ check if the player is actively checking or a passive _Perception_ check.

#### Always With Fire

A spill of hidden [Oil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Oil1SP) douses you. Make a DC 15 DEX check to avoid being covered.

#### Clumsy Progress

The 10-foot passage ahead is clearly covered by [Ball Bearings](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#BallBearings1GP). The ceiling is too low to fly.

#### Deep Pit

The pit is 30 feet deep and covered at bottom in spikes. A falling creature takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d10 piercing damage. The spikes are coated in [carrion crawler mucus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/555-carrion-crawler-mucus). The opening is 5' by 5' and the bottom is 10' by 10'.

When a creature falls into the pit, a [net](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Net1GP) falls from the ceiling into the pit over the creature. Make a 15 DC Dexterity check to avoid being [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) for 1 round.

#### Fake Dead End

Ahead, the passage comes to a dead end. The stonework looks partially finished and incomplete, with loose stones and rubble piled in the corners.

This is a sophisticated, two-layer trap designed to sow confusion and waste the party&rsquo;s time and resources:

- An actual false wall.
- An illusion of the same wall overlaid on top.

#### Falling Rocks

The ceiling collapses. Make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid 4d10 damage. It will take 30 minutes to clear the passage. Investigation does not reveal a new passage.

#### Flame-thrower

#### Harmless Tarp

Hung across the passage ahead is a heavy dark tarp. It muffles sound edges are affixed to the walls and floor.

There is no trap here, it is a distraction, however an opportunity for kobolds to setup an ambush or provide an additional trap just behond.

#### Murder Galore

Even &ldquo;clear&rdquo; passages are not safe. The walls are lined with clearly visible murder holes, some just small cracks and others fist-sized openings.

- _**Behind the Holes:**_ A creature firing from a murder hole has three-quarters [cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Cover) (+5 to AC and DEX saves).
- _**In the Tunnels:**_ Breaking through a wall (AC 15, 30 HP) reveals the 3-foot-by-3-foot sniper&rsquo;s nest, which connects to a larger network of unlit, 3-foot-high tunnels.
- _**Cramped Space:**_ A _Small_ creature can move through this network by [crawling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Crawling). A _Medium_ or larger creature cannot enter at all. In addition while crawling a creature is [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#ProneCondition).

#### No Magic

You trigger a [Glyph of Warding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#GlyphofWarding) that casts an enhanced [Dispel Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#DispelMagic). Within 10 feet all spells or spell effects end. Casters lose _Concentration_. Magic items are non-magical for 10 minutes. You can detect this glyph with a DC 15 _Perception_ check.

#### Painful Progress

The 10-foot passage ahead is clearly covered by [Caltrops](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Caltrops1GP). The ceiling is too low to fly.

#### Summonng

#### Start Again

The character is teleported back to the cave entrance and see a heavy metal door barring reentry as they arrive.

#### Trecherous Deep Pit

In addition to a _Deep Pit_ there is a creature at the bottom. Roll a 1d6 for the creature:

| Roll | Monster |
|:--:|:--|
| 1 | [Black Pudding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194925-black-pudding) |
| 2 | [Cloaker](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194946-cloaker) |
| 3 | [Gelatinous Cube](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195005-gelatinous-cube) |
| 4 | [Mimic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195123-mimic) appearing as spikes |
| 5 | [Rust Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195186-rust-monster) |
| 6 | Roll twice ignoring this result. |

#### Wet

Within 10 feet any creature and their posssessions are drentched. Non-magical light sources are extinguished and cannot be relit while wet. Creatures and items dry out after 10 minutes. While wet a character or item is at disadvantage for cold or lightning damage.
