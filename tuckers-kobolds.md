# Tucker&rsquo;s Kobolds

A one-shot _Dungeon Crawl_ for powerful characters based on the famous _Tucker&rsquo;s Kobolds_ from [_Dragon 127_](https://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/TuckersKobolds.pdf), a popular tournament dungeon and updated for D&amp;D 5e.

{note}
The party prepares for a "big boss" encounter only to find _Death by 1,000 cuts_ from puny Kobolds. Make adventuring miserable for powerful characters. The underdog wins by preparation, tactics, guile and cunning.
{note}

### DM Goals

**Your goal**: _Kill the characters though your monsters are vastly outmatched_.

Make the party retreat while screaming: _Oh no, here come the Kobolds again!_

### DM Strategy

Characters should win direct 1-on-1 combat. But you don&rsquo;t plan to lose. Heavy use of traps, hidden positions, mob tactics, and draining the characters yield the field to your monsters against a powerful party. The Kobolds are skirmishers and tacticians:

- Split the party.
- Drain character resources to waste powerful actions.
- Offer false choices.
- Use "hide and seek" tactics from murder holes.
- Force frequent DC checks that eventually fail.
- Plant stronger monsters effectively.

Players will spend turns to use _Perception_ or _Investigation_ checks, or cast the unhelpful [Find Traps](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#FindTraps) spell. Pepper them with ranged damage from inaccessible positions to encourage moving on.

### Hook the Characters

_**The Ruse.**_ Provide a suitable story hook that a party of powerful characters would undertake a _Dungeon Crawl_.

Emphasize a &ldquo;big bad boss&rdquo;, &ldquo;powerful magics&rdquo;, a &ldquo;tribe of unstoppable raiders&rdquo; and so on. Encourage player focus to single or high-level targets. Examples include:

- The Mayor&rsquo;s child was kidnapped nearby.
- The _MacGuffin_ was carried into nearby caves.
- Evil near stirs and threatens our livelihood.
- The Rebel and his forces hole up just over there.
- Foul unnatural smells come from those caves.

### Powerful Characters

Players should create or use higher-level but not end-game characters: levels 10-13 is good level range. Use the opening hook to encourage single-target attacks, nova damage, strong spell casters, so on.

Adjust the DC of traps or choices of monsters to suit the overall party level.

### Travel

There is one main passage kept in poor, rough-going condition, covered in slimes and oozes and mixed debris; everything else is a maze of tunnels. Travel is [Difficult Terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain) at best. Even the main passage turns every 30' or less blocking view. The main passage is 10' by 10' high and wide and tunnels are 3' by 3'.

A _Small_ creature can move through tunnels by [crawling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Crawling). A _Medium_ or larger creature cannot enter at all. In addition while crawling a creature is [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#ProneCondition).

### Constant Danger

Even the main passage is not safe. Clearly visible murder holes line the walls and ceilings, some just small cracks and others fist-sized openings. Kobolds attack characters with ranged weapons or dropping or hurling [Oil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Oil1SP).

Take advantage of murder holes to harry characters when characters focus on traps.

_**Behind the Holes.**_ Kobolds fire from murder holes and have three-quarters [cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Cover). They can fire at any target in a cone starting from their position (3 targets adjacent in the main 10' passage, 5 targets opposite). Ranged attacks from a murder hole do not have [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) when targeting an adjacent creature, and attacks into a murder hole are at [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Disadvantage).

_**Into the Tunnels.**_ Breaking through a wall (AC 15, 30 HP) reveals the 3-foot-by-3-foot sniper&rsquo;s nest which connects to a network of small unlit tunnels.

### Balancing the Challenges

Dangers and traps are throughout the dungeon and may be more challenging than expected. Active searching can locate a trap or hazard with an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check.

- _**Mundane Checks (DC 19):**_ Use DC 19 for checks to spot physical traps (like a pit or false wall).
- _**Magical Checks (DC 23):**_ Use DC 23 for checks to spot magical traps (like a Glyph of Warding).
- _**Mundane Saves (DC 19):**_ Use DC 19 for saving throws against physical traps (like _Falling Rocks_ or _Oil_).
- _**Magical Saves (DC 17):**_ Use DC 17 for saving throws against magical traps or spells (like _Start Again_ or the spells from _Magic Marker_).

The DM can raise or lower skill and saving throw DCs based on party composition and levels and as play evolves.

## Example Traps

Traps come with &ldquo;Rating&rdquo; and &ldquo;Role&rdquo; tags. _Rating_ gives a sense of challenge; _Role_ is a suggestion when and where to use a trap in the dungeon crawl.

#### Always with Fire
_(Rating: 3/10; Role: Setup)_

Hidden spills of [Oil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Oil1SP) pour from above within 10', and oil pours from murder holes onto the floor 30' in both directions. Each creature in range must make a **Mundane Dexterity saving throw** to avoid dousing from above.

#### Cruel Cultivation
_(Rating: 7/10; Role: Attrition)_

The Kobolds cultivate various hazards.

Roll 1d8:

| Roll | Hazard |
|:--:|:--|
| 1 | [Brown Fungus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#BrownMold) |
| 2 | [Fireball Fungus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#FireballFungus) |
| 3 | [Green Slime](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#GreenSlime) |
| 4 | [Razorvine](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#Razorvine) |
| 5 | [Vicious Vine](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#ViciousVine) |
| 6 | [Webs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#Webs) |
| 7 | [Yellow Mold](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/dms-toolbox#YellowMold) |
| 8 | Roll twice ignoring this or a previous result. There are two hazards. |

**Tougher Challenge.** These hazards are more potent. Replace any saving throw DC in the hazard&rsquo;s description with the appropriate DC from the **Balancing the Challenges** section.

#### Deep Pit
_(Rating: 8/10; Role: Attrition)_

The pit is 30' deep and covered at bottom in spikes. A falling creature takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d10 piercing damage without save. The spikes are coated in [Carrion Crawler Mucus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/555-carrion-crawler-mucus). The opening is 5' by 5' and the bottom is 10' by 10'.

When a creature falls into the pit, a [Net](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Net1GP) falls from the ceiling. The creature must make a **Mundane Dexterity saving throw** to avoid being [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition) by the net.

\column

#### Fake Dead End
_(Rating: 4/10; Role: Psychological)_

Ahead, the passage comes to a dead end. The stonework looks partially finished and incomplete, with loose stones and rubble piled in the corners. There is both:

- An actual false wall (AC 15, 15 HP, [Damage Threshold](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#DamageThreshold) 10).
- An illusion of the same wall overlaid on top. Dispeling or disbelieving the illusion reveals no visual change.

Breaking down the false wall takes 10 minutes and echoes loudly on both sides.

#### Falling Rocks
_(Rating: 8/10; Role: Attrition)_

The ceiling collapses for 20' in either direction. No new passages are revealed. Each creature in the area must make a **Mundane Dexterity saving throw**.

* **On a failed save:** A creature takes 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage, is knocked **[prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#ProneCondition)**, and is **buried**.
* **On a successful save:** A creature takes half as much damage only but is still **[prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#ProneCondition)** and on top of the rubble.

A **buried** creature is **[restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition)** and has **[Total Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Cover)**. As an action, a buried creature can try to crawl out by making a **Mundane Strength (Athletics) check**. If the check fails, the creature remains buried and gains 1 **[exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition)** level.

A creature can spend 1 minute freeing another buried creature. Clearing the debris for passage takes **30 minutes** of work.

#### Flame-thrower
_(Rating: 4/10; Role: Payoff)_

Kobolds range attack from murder holes with homemade weapons shooting jets of fire similar to the [Fire Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#FireBolt) spell. Any [Oil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Oil1SP) on creatures or objects ignites.

#### Harmless Tarp
_(Rating: 2/10; Role: Psychological)_

Hung across the passage ahead is a heavy dark tarp. It muffles sound edges are affixed to the walls and floor.

There is no trap here, it is a distraction. This gives the Kobolds an opportunity to ambush from behind or ahead.

If a creature collects the tarp, it weighs 30 lbs. and is otherwise dark and ordinary.

#### Magic Marker
_(Rating: 8/10; Role: Attrition and Deadly)_

A [Glyph of Warding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#GlyphofWarding) is hard to notice. The trap triggers when any character is within 5'. Kobolds range attack from their murder holes. If a Kobold is affected by a spell from the glyph, it retreats.

Roll 1d12 for the spell stored in the glyph:

| Roll | Spell |
|:--:|:--|
| 1 | [Cloud of Daggers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618974-cloud-of-daggers) |
| 2 | [Faerie Fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#FaerieFire) |
| 3 | [Fear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Fear) |
| 4 | [Fog Cloud](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#FogCloud) |
| 5 | [Grease](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Grease) |
| 6 | [Hypnotic Pattern](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#HypnoticPattern) |
| 7 | [Shatter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Shatter) |
| 8 | [Silence](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Silence) |
| 9 | [Stinking Cloud](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#StinkingCloud) |
| 10 | [Thunderwave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Thunderwave) |
| 11 | [Web](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#Web)
| 12 | Roll twice ignoring this or a previous result. There are two glyphs and each is a separate spell casting. |

#### No Magic
_(Rating: 10/10; Role: Deadly)_

You trigger a [Glyph of Warding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#GlyphofWarding) that casts an enhanced [Dispel Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#DispelMagic). Within 10' all spells or spell effects end. Casters lose [concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Concentration). Magic items are non-magical for 10 minutes.

#### Summoning
_(Rating: 8/10; Role: Attrition or Psychological)_

At the DM&rsquo;s discretion a _Glyph of Warding_ contains an upcast spell to summon one or more creatures of the DM&rsquo;s choice or cast [Programmed Illusion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#ProgrammedIllusion) of them.

#### Start Again
_(Rating: 9/10; Role: Split the Party)_

The character is teleported back to the cave entrance and see a heavy metal door barring reentry as they arrive.

#### Three-way Failure
_(Rating: 7/10; Role: Attrition, Setup, and Split the Party)_

The main passage splits into 3 choices. Each alternative passage contains more traps and opportunities for Kobolds to harry the party.

- **Left Choice.** The passage continues levelly 20' into a sharp turn left.
- **Center Choice.** The passage continues downwards for 60' before curving right.
- **Right Choice.** The passage continues upwards 20' into a sharp turn right.

All choices lead to a _Fake Dead End_ trap. The DM chooses which continues, and which are true dead ends.

\column

#### Too Easy
_(Rating: 2/10; Role: Attrition and Setup)_

The 20-foot passage ahead is covered by [Ball Bearings](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#BallBearings1GP), [Caltrops](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Caltrops1GP) or glistening [Oil](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/equipment#Oil1SP).

#### Treacherous Deep Pit
_(Rating: 9/10; Role: Deadly)_

In addition to a _Deep Pit_ there is a creature at the bottom. Roll 1d8 for the creature:

| Roll | Monster |
|:--:|:--|
| 1 | [Black Pudding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/creature-stat-blocks#BlackPudding) |
| 2 | [Cloaker](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/creature-stat-blocks#Cloaker) |
| 3 | [Gelatinous Cube](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/creature-stat-blocks#GelatinousCube) |
| 4 | [Gray Oooze](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/creature-stat-blocks#GrayOoze) |
| 5 | [Mimic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/creature-stat-blocks#Mimic) appearing as spikes |
| 6 | [Rust Monster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/creature-stat-blocks#RustMonster) |
| 7 | [Trapper](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560944-trapper) |
| 8 | Roll twice ignoring this result. |

#### Wet
_(Rating: 1/10; Role: Setup)_

Within 10' any creature and their possessions are drenched. Non-magical light sources are extinguished and cannot be relit while wet. Creatures and items dry out after 10 minutes. While wet a character or item is at _Disadvantage_ for cold or lightning damage.
