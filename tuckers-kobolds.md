# Tucker&rsquo;s Kobolds

A one-shot adventure for high level characters based on the famous _Tucker&rsquo;s Kobolds_ from [_Dragon 127_](https://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/TuckersKobolds.pdf). This was a popular tournament dungeon from then updated here for D&amp;D 5e.

{note}
The party prepares for a "big boss" encounter only to find _death by 1,000 cuts_ from Kobolds.
Your goal is to make adventuring miserable for a party of high-level characters, and negate their "super" powers.
{note}

Monsters employ cunning and rely heavily on traps. They are skirmishers and avoid direct combat. Example tactics include:

- Traps or tactics that split the character party.
- Lean into character checks that are weak at higher-levels.
- "Hide and seek" tactics of firing ranged weapons from tunnels or murder holes, and denying a clear target for characters to attack.
- Summoning other suitable monsters to waste character time while the Kobolds regroup.
- Reliance on fire or poison for trap or weapon damange with frequent DC checks until some fail.
