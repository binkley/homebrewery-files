# 🔥 Mephistopheles and the Delerium Crucible

### Patron of Controlled Fire | Lawful Evil Fiend | Ally of Pragmatists

> *“Fire is not destruction—it is revelation. It proves what deserves to endure.”*
> — Mephistopheles, Archduke of Cania

---

## ⚗️ The Pact of the Calculated Flame

**Warlock:** Malach, Tiefling Fighter 1 / Warlock 1 (Fiend Patron)
**Current Contamination:** Level 3
**Delerium Carried:** 6 chips (2 bound in a locket)

Mephistopheles regards Malach as a *living experiment*—a mortal who can balance the alien power of Delerium with the disciplined mastery of Hellfire.
He does not forbid Malach’s corruption; he measures it.

> *“The weak are consumed by delerium. You, my student, consume it in turn. Continue your calibration.”*

## 🩸 The Locket of Canian Resonance

**Story Item** — A silver locket containing two bound shards of delerium, etched with infernal runes.
While worn, Malach’s fire spells emit no heat—only light like burning ice.

**Effect:** When casting a 2nd-level or higher spell, roll d20.
• On 1 — Con save (DC 13) or gain 1 Contamination.
• On 20 — Increase the spell’s DC or range by +1 / +10 ft.
**Appeasement:** Once per day, destroy one shard to prevent the roll.

> *“The locket is your crucible. Feed it carefully, lest it decide it no longer needs you.”*

## 🧊 Patron Presence

* Flames burn blue-white, shedding frost instead of smoke.
* Mirrors frost from within when Mephistopheles speaks.
* The scent of ozone follows every teleport or flame spell.
* In dreams, the voice says only: *“Measure. Record. Endure.”*

## 🎭 Voice of Mephistopheles

* *“Efficiency is mercy for time.”*
* *“Another shard? Good. Note the after-image duration.”*
* *“You are not addicted; you are calibrated.”*
* *“Spend your soul wisely, and the interest shall be eternal.”*

## ⚖️ Alignment Fit: Neutral → Neutral Evil

Malach is not cruel—he is efficient.
Mephistopheles cultivates this neutrality: he prizes *control over passion*.
The Fiend’s temptation is not rage or greed but **optimization**—the slow erosion of empathy in favor of precision.

> *“Morality is noise in the signal. Silence it, and your flame will burn true.”*
