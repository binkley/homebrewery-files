# Arcane Autography, Introduction

This thin volume serves both as a _spellbook_ and a [spellcasting focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#SpellcastingFocus). It and any spells written in its pages or notes therein can't be damaged by fire or immersion in water. In addition, the book doesn't deteriorate with age or use. This _Uncommon_ item functions similarly to an [Enduring Spellbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/27047-enduring-spellbook), and grants additional magical features. This is the first volume of a set.

The well-used tome smells faintly of ozone and lilac ink and is a cornucopia of magic history. Each page reveals arcane history that changed the world and refers to other volumes. The author of this compendium is unknown, and styles themself as "Q". Under the front cover is pressed one perfect rose permanently affixed.

Copying a new spell into blank pages takes the same time and gold cost as writing it into a normal spellbook.

### Introduction

{{note
Of course I write this for myself. I like a good author, and I appreciate an intelligent reader. A spellbook page, like good tailoring, should reveal just enough.

The only cure for boredom is curiosity. As _curiosity has no cure_. If you have young friends aspring to wizardship, the second-greatest favor you can do is present them with _Elminster&rsquo;s Biography_, the full series. The first-greatest, of course, is to [fire bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#FireBolt) them now while they're happy.

If I had a silver for every self-proclaimed archmage, I'd buy them all a mirror. Each volume of mine is useful. See _L&ndash;M_ if you wonder how _acidic geometry_ kills you. Watch out for _Rary_ or _Elminster_ or _Mordenkainen_ unless you enjoy that sort of thing. They do tempt.

It's all about who you know &mdash; and who knows you. Posterity is a crapshoot, children are unreliable, and that bard song about you is in the wrong key.

Send me missing autographs or spells from reluctant casters. Dead is not an excuse. _Abi-Dalzim_ (that ink-dryer), _Big George_ (an absolute riot), _[Fizban](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#Fizban)_ (when not tottering), _Galther_ (or Galder, no one is sure), _Jim_ (we've got to do dinner sometime; your people talk to my people), _Mora_ (you won't know him, but I do), _Raulothim_ (bring a gift) and others. <br />&mdash; Q.

### Table of Volumes

#### Introduction

Start here, if you must. Not that anyone reads introductions. I don't. You may easily stumble across this volume.

#### A&ndash;D

_Aganazzar_, _[Bigby](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#Bigby)_, and others who blew themselves up or became footnotes. Some good stuff, if you dig. Hard to find this volume but not challenging.

\column

#### [Elminster](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#Elminster)

He gets his own volume. He insisted. I let him write half himself. Then I crossed it out. Then he erased everything and I'm left with an empty reference book. Challenging to find this volume, he let me make only so many copies.

#### E&ndash;J

A loose-lipped gossiper, an obsessive for her pet, poor weather, and delightfully grasping tentacles &mdash; who's bringing the cockatrices? If you expected _[Iggwilv](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#BabaYaga)_ here, go see the _Tasha_ volume. You didn't know her that well. Hard to find this volume but not challenging.

#### L&ndash;M

Pleasant _Leomund_ and _Melf_&rsquo;s obsession with acidic geometries. Draw them out in conversation or you lose their attention. Hard to find this volume but not challenging.

#### [Mordenkainen](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#Mordenkainen)

He turned out more notable wizard apprentices than anyone else. A natural born teacher, and we know what those are like. And the rudest person outside the planes. Challenging to find this volume, they keep getting acquired.

#### N&ndash;O

This is the group at dinner parties who get out of hand. That _[Otto](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#Otto)_ knows how to get things swinging &mdash; and dancing. Don't confuse with the prune _[Otiluke](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#Otiluke)_. Hard to find this volume but not challenging.

#### [Tasha](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#Tasha)

_Dear Tasha, let's do dinner sometime. I'll bring the flowers if you bring the terror and passion._ Avoid her [mother](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#BabaYaga). Challenging to find this volume. And not listed as _[Iggwilv](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#Iggwilv)_. She just wasn't the same.

{{note
_They hail you as their morning star_ <br>
_Because you are the way you are._ <br>
_If you return the sentiment,_ <br>
_They'll try to make you different;_ <br>
_And once they have you, safe and sound,_ <br>
_They want to change you all around._
}}

#### R&ndash;Y

This volume's a mess. Blame _Nystul_. Or _Rary_. Or me. Just don't ask about "P". And don't trust _Rary_. Be frightened of _[Yolande](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/dmg-2024/lore-glossary#Yolande)_ and she'll appreciate you. Hard to find this volume but not challenging.

#### Z

I hesitate to write this volume. You could be cut, burned, pierced, hung. Might as well live.<br />I wrote this only once and need more drink.

{{note
Secondhand spells, like secondhand shoes, don't tell where they've been, but fit for now. Don't think about where they've been.<br />&mdash; Q.
}}

### Spells Already Present

When you come across this book and cast [Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619097-detect-magic), you discover that it is a magical spellbook containing scribed spells and commentary. The pages are organized by author, and follow with blank pages suitable for copying in new spells from any school or other authors.

Casting [Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619180-identify) reveals details for the spells already written in the book including originals in many authors' hands. You can prepare or copy a spell from the book only if it appears on your class&rsquo;s spell list, or if a class feature (such as _Magical Secrets_) lets you use spells from another class.

{{note
I scribbled simple spells as an exercise. I do love teasing.<br />&mdash; Q.
}}

- [Dancing Lights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#DancingLights) &mdash; _And who doesn't enjoy a party?_
- [Encode Thoughts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/83532-encode-thoughts) (_Guildmasters&rsquo; Guide to Ravnica_) &mdash; Just some good bookmarks.
- [Friends](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618924-friends) &mdash; I make quick friends. Up to them if they stay after.
- [Vicious Mockery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/spell-descriptions#ViciousMockery) &mdash; _Don't look at me in that tone of voice._

### About the Crafter

Nothing in the volume reveals the identity of "Q" though some have noted the editor's obsession with _Iggwilv/Tasha_ in the notes, and acerbic comments. The crafter seems sharp-tongued and potent.
