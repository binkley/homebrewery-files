### Traits

**Contaminating Presence (Contamination, Aura 120 ft.).**  
Each creature that starts its turn within 120 feet of the Amalgamation must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw.  
On a failure, it gains one level of *Contamination* and takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage; on a success, it takes half damage.

**Immutable Form.** The Amalgamation is immune to any effect that would alter its form.  

**Malignancy.** It can’t be teleported or moved to another plane against its will.  

**Rejuvenation.** If destroyed in the Mortal World, it reforms in the Space Between Worlds 1d10 days later unless its roots there are also destroyed.  

**Ultimate Corruption.** Necrotic damage dealt by the Amalgamation ignores resistance and treats immunity as resistance.

### Epic Actions (initiative count 20; loses ties)
On its turn the Amalgamation doesn’t take normal actions or bonus actions. Instead, it takes one **Epic Action** at the end of each other creature’s turn and regains all expended Epic Actions at the start of its turn.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 36 (4d12 + 10) force damage.  
If the target is Large or smaller and grappled, the grapple ends and the target is **swallowed**.  
A swallowed creature is **blinded** and **restrained**, has total cover from outside effects, and takes 42 (12d6) necrotic damage plus one *Contamination* level at the start of each of the Amalgamation’s turns.  
If it takes 50 or more damage in a turn from inside, it must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution save or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone within 10 ft.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (4d8 + 10) force damage and the target is **grappled** (escape DC 25). While grappled, the target is **restrained**. The Amalgamation has twelve tentacles, each able to grapple one target.

***Fling.*** One Large or smaller creature or object grappled by the Amalgamation is thrown up to 60 feet and falls prone. If it hits a solid surface, it takes 35 (10d6) force damage. If thrown at another creature, that creature must make a DC 25 Dexterity save or take the same damage and fall prone.

***Mind-Breaking Whispers (Recharge 5–6).*** The Amalgamation targets one creature within 120 ft. DC 25 Intelligence save. On a failure, the target becomes **insane** until it finishes a long rest (the condition functions as *confusion* and *feeblemind* combined). Regardless of the save, it takes 70 (20d6) psychic damage. A *greater restoration* or *heal* spell ends the effect.

***Forced Mutation (1/round).*** Each creature within 120 feet that has one or more *Contamination* levels takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and gains a random mutation chosen by the DM.

***Piper at the Gate (1/round).*** A Pyknic Maunder appears in an unoccupied space within 30 ft. of the Amalgamation. It acts after the Amalgamation on initiative count 20 and obeys its commands. The Amalgamation can control up to ten Maunders at once.

***Epic Resistance (3/Day).*** The Amalgamation chooses one effect currently affecting it and rolls 1d20; on an 11 or higher the effect ends. It can use this Epic Action even while incapacitated or controlled.

### Tactics
The Amalgamation is a living mass of matter and madness. It opens combat with *Mind-Breaking Whispers* to disable casters, then uses *Tentacle* and *Bite* to consume front-liners. Its aura spreads *Contamination* rapidly across the battlefield — destroying it is the only way to end the corruption.

### Design Notes (for DM)
- Uses 2024 Initiative and Epic Action timing.  
- “Ultimate Corruption” replaces typical resistance tracking.  
- CR 23 validated: Defensive CR ≈ 22 (AC 18, scaling HP); Offensive CR ≈ 23 (DPR ≈ 120 per round).  
- Intended as a world-ending boss — avoid running multiple per party!
