## Harsh Glare (Cantrip enchantment)

> _A glare that bites deeper than words._

{{note
Commonly known among witches as the _Evil Eye_, this spell channels your will into a piercing glance to one or others.
}}

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You fix your gaze on a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 psychic damage and be unable to take a reaction until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes no damage and suffers no additional effect.

This spell has no effect on targets that you cannot see or that cannot see you, such as yourself or targets blinded, invisible, or lacking visual senses. You must be within a target&rsquo;s line of sight; if you can see a target, you can discern whether it can see you. The force of your gaze when casting is sufficient to briefly turn their glance to you as you cast this spell.

If you cast this spell, you can't take a _Magic Action_ on the same turn.

### Cantrip Upgrade

You may target additional creatures when you reach levels 5 (up to 2 creatures), 11 (up to 3 creatures), and 17 (up to 4 creatures).
